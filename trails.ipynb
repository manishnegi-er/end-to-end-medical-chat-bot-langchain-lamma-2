Page xv\\nPreface\\nAudience\\nThis textbook presents an introduction to reinforced concrete design. We authors hope the\\nmaterial is written in such a manner as to interest students in the subject and to encourage\\nthem to continue its study in the years to come. The text was prepared with an introductory\\nthree-credit course in mind, but sufﬁcient material is included for an additional three-credit\\ncourse.\\nNew to This Edition\\nUpdated Code\\nWith the ninth edition of this text, the contents have been updated to conform to the 2011\\nBuilding Code of the American Concrete Institute (ACI 318-11). Changes to this edition of the\\ncode include:\\n• Factored load combinations are now based on ASCE/SEI 7-10, which now treats wind\\nas a strength level load.\\n• Minor revisions to development length to headed bars.\\n• Addition of minimum reinforcement provisions to deep beams.\\n• Introduction of Grade 80 deformed bars in accordance with ASTM 615 and ASTM 706.\\n• Zinc and epoxy dual-coated reinforcing bars are now permitted in accordance with ASTM\\nA1055.\\nNew Chapter on Concrete Masonry\\nA new chapter on strength design of reinforced concrete masonry has been added to replace the\\nprevious Chapter 20 on formwork. Surveys revealed that the forms chapter was not being used\\nand that a chapter on masonry would be more valuable. Because strength design of reinforced\\nconcrete masonry is so similar to that of reinforced concrete, the authors felt that this would be\\na logical extension to the application of the theories developed earlier in the text. The design\\nof masonry lintels, walls loaded out-of-plane, and shear walls are included. The subject of this\\nchapter could easily occupy an entire textbook, so this chapter is limited in scope to only the\\nbasics. An example of the design of each type of masonry element is also included to show\\nthe student some typical applications.\\nxv'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='McCormac fpref.tex V2 - January 10, 2013 6:36 P.M. Page xvi\\nxvi PREFACE\\nUnits Added to Example Problems\\nThe example problems now have units associated with the input values. This will assist the\\nstudent in determining the source of each i nput value as well as help in the use of dimensional\\nanalysis in determining the correct answers and the units of the answers. Often the student\\ncan catch errors in calculations simply by checking the dimensions of the calculated answer\\nagainst what the units are known to be.\\nOrganization\\nThe text is written in the order that the authors feel would follow the normal sequence of\\npresentation for an introductory course in reinforced concrete design.

Sometimes one or more admixtures are added\\nto change certain characteristics of the concrete such as its workability, durability, and time of\\nhardening.\\nAs with most rocklike substances, concrete has a high compressive strength and a very\\nlow tensile strength. Reinforced concrete is a combination of concrete and steel wherein the\\nsteel reinforcement provides the tensile strength lacking in the concrete. Steel reinforcing is also\\ncapable of resisting compression forces and is used in columns as well as in other situations,\\nwhich are described later.\\n1.2 Advantages of Reinforced Concrete as a\\nStructural Material\\nReinforced concrete may be the most important material available for construction. It is used\\nin one form or another for almost all structures, great or small—buildings, bridges, pavements,\\ndams, retaining walls, tunnels, drainage and irrigation facilities, tanks, and so on.\\nThe tremendous su ccess of this universal construction material can be understood quite\\neasily if its numerous advantages are considered. These include the following:\\n1. It has considerable compressive strength per unit cost compared with most other mate-\\nrials.\\n2. Reinforced concrete has great resistance to the actions of ﬁre and water and, in fact, is\\nthe best structural material available for situations where water is present. During ﬁres\\nof average intensity, members with a satisfactory cover of concrete over the reinforcing\\nbars suffer only surface damage without failure.\\n3. Reinforced concrete structures are very rigid.\\n4. It is a low-maintenance material.\\n5. As compared with other materials, it has a very long service life. Under proper conditions,\\nreinforced concrete structures can be used indeﬁnitely without reduction of their load-\\ncarrying abilities. This can be explained by the fact that the strength of concrete does\\nnot decrease with time but actually increases over a very long period, measured in years,\\nbecause of the lengthy process of the solidiﬁcation of the cement paste.\\n6. It is usually the only economical material available for footings, ﬂoor slabs, basement\\nwalls, piers, and similar applications.\\n7. A special feature of concrete is its ability to be cast into an extraordinary variety of\\nshapes from simple slabs, beams, and columns to great arches and shells.\\n1'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 21}, page_content='McCormac c01.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 2:57 P.M.

In most areas, concrete takes advantage of inexpensive local materials (sand, gravel, and\\nwater) and requires relatively small amounts of cement and reinforcing steel, which may\\nhave to be shipped from other parts of the country.\\n9. A lower grade of skilled labor is required for erection as compared with other materials\\nsuch as structural steel.\\n1.3 Disadvantages of Reinforced Concrete as a\\nStructural Material\\nTo use concrete successfully, the designer must be completely familiar with its weak points as\\nwell as its strong ones. Among its disadvantages are the following:\\n1. Concrete has a very low tensile strength, requiring the use of tensile reinforcing.\\n2. Forms are required to hold the concrete in place until it hardens sufﬁciently. In addi-\\ntion, falsework or shoring may be n ecessary to keep the forms in place for roofs, walls,\\nﬂoors, and similar structures until the concrete members gain sufﬁcient strength to sup-\\nport themselves. Formwork is very expensive. In the United States, its costs run from\\none-third to two-thirds of the total cost of a reinforced concrete structure, with average'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 22}, page_content='McCormac c01.tex V2 - January 10, 2013 9:10 P.M.

It should be obvious that when efforts are made to improve the\\neconomy of reinforced concrete structures, the major emphasis is on reducing formwork\\ncosts.\\n3. The low strength per unit of weight of concrete leads to heavy members. This becomes\\nan increasingly important matter for long-span structures, where concrete’s large dead\\nweight has a great effect on bending moment s. Lightweight aggregates can be used to\\nreduce concrete weight, but the cost of the concrete is increased.\\n4. Similarly, the low strength per unit of volume of concrete means members will be\\nrelatively large, an important consideration for tall buildings and long-span structures.\\n5. The properties of concrete vary widely because of variations in its pr oportioning and\\nmixing. Furthermore, the placing and curing of concrete is not as carefully controlled\\nas is the production of other materials, such as structural steel and laminated wood.\\nTwo other characteristics that can cause problems are concrete’s shrinkage and creep.\\nThese characteristics are discussed in Section 1.11 of this chapter.\\n1.4 Historical Background\\nMost people believe that concrete has been in common use for many centuries, but this is\\nnot the case. The Romans did make use of a cement calledpozzolana before the birth of\\nChrist. They found large deposits of a sandy volcanic ash near Mt. V esuvius and in other\\nplaces in Italy. When they mixed this material with quicklime and water as well as sand\\nand gravel, it hardened into a rocklike substance and was used as a building material. One\\nmight expect that a relatively poor grade of concrete would result, as compared with today’s\\nstandards, but some Roman concrete structures are still in existence today. One example is\\nthe Pantheon (a building dedicated to all gods), which is located in Rome and was completed\\nin a.d. 126.\\nThe art of making pozzolanic concrete was lost during the Dark Ages and was not revived\\nuntil the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. A deposit of natural cement rock was discovered\\nin England in 1796 and was sold as “Roman cement.” V arious other deposits of natural cement\\nwere discovered in both Europe and America and were used for several decades.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 23}, page_content='McCormac c01.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 2:57 P.M. Page 4\\n4 CHAPTER 1 Introduction\\nThe real breakthrough for concrete occurred in 1824, when an English bricklayer named\\nJoseph Aspdin, after long and laborious experiments, obtained a patent for a cement that he\\ncalled portland cement because its color was quite similar to that of the stone quarried on the\\nIsle of Portland off the English coast. He made his cement by taking certain quantities of clay\\nand limestone, pulverizing them, burning them in his kitchen stove, and grinding the resulting\\nclinker into a ﬁne powder. During the early years after its development, his cement was used\\nprimarily in stuccos.1 This wonderful product was adopted very slowly by the building industry\\nand was not even introduced in the United States until 1868; the ﬁrst portland cement was not\\nmanufactured in the United States until the 1870s.\\nThe ﬁrst uses of concrete are not very well known. Much of the early work was done\\nby the Frenchmen Franc¸ois Le Brun, Joseph Lambot, and Joseph Monier. In 1832, Le Brun\\nbuilt a concrete house and followed it with the construction of a school and a church with\\nthe same material. In about 1850, Lambot built a concrete boat reinforced with a network\\nof parallel wires or bars. Credit is usually given to Monier, however, for the invention of\\nreinforced concrete. In 1867, he received a patent for the construction of concrete basins or\\ntubs and reservoirs reinforced with a mesh of iron wire. His stated goal in working with this\\nmaterial was to obtain lightness without sacriﬁcing strength.2\\nFrom 1867 to 1881, Monier r eceived patents for reinforced concrete railroad ties, ﬂoor\\nslabs, arches, footbridges, buildings, and other items in both France and Germany. Another\\nFrenchman, Franc¸ois Coignet, built simple reinforced concrete structures and developed basic\\nmethods of design. In 1861, he published a book in which he presented quite a few applications.\\nHe was the ﬁrst person to realize that the addition of too much water to the mix greatly reduced\\nconcrete’s strength. Other Europeans who were early experimenters with reinforced concrete\\nincluded the Englishmen William Fairbairn and William B. Wilkinson, the German G. A.\\nWayss, and another Frenchman, Franc¸ois Hennebique. 3,4\\nWilliam E. Ward built the ﬁrst reinforced concrete building in the United States in Port\\nChester, New York, in 1875. In 1883, he presented a paper before the American Society of\\nMechanical Engineers in which he claimed that he got the idea of reinforced concrete by\\nwatching English laborers in 1867 trying to remove hardened cement from their iron tools.5\\nThaddeus Hyatt, an American, was probably the ﬁrst person to correctly analyze the\\nstresses in a reinforced concrete beam, and in 1877, he published a 28-page book on the\\nsubject, entitled An Account of Some Experiments with Portland Cement Concrete, Combined\\nwith Iron as a Building Material . In this book he praised the use of reinforced concrete and\\nsaid that “rolled beams (steel) have to be taken largely on faith.” Hyatt put a great deal of\\nemphasis on the high ﬁre resistance of concrete.6\\nE. L. Ransome of San Francisco reportedly used reinforced concrete in the early 1870s\\nand was the originator of deformed (or twisted) bars, for which he received a patent in 1884.\\nThese bars, which were square in cross section, were cold-twisted with one complete turn in\\na length of not more than 12 times the bar diameter.7 (The purpose of the twisting was to\\nprovide better bonding or adhesion of the concrete and the steel.) In 1890 in San Francisco,\\nRansome built the Leland Stanford Jr. Museum. It is a reinforced concrete building 312 ft\\nlong and 2 stories high in which discarded wire rope from a cable-car system was used as\\ntensile reinforcing. This building experienced little damage in the 1906 earthquake and the ﬁre\\n1 Kirby, R. S. and Laurson, P.

The limited damage to this building and other concrete structures that withstood\\nthe great 1906 ﬁre led to the widespreadacceptance of this form of construction on the West\\nCoast. Since the early 1900s, the development and use of reinforced concrete in the United\\nStates has been very rapid.8,9\\n1.5 Comparison of Reinforced Concrete and Structural Steel\\nfor Buildings and Bridges\\nWhen a particular type of structure is being considered, the student may be puzzled by the\\nquestion, “Should reinforced concrete or structural steel be used?” There is much joking on this\\npoint, with the proponents of reinforced concrete referring to steel as that material that rusts\\nand those favoring structural steel referring to concrete as the material that, when overstressed,\\ntends to return to its natural state—that is, sand and gravel.\\nThere is no simple answer to this question, inasmuch as both of these materials have\\nmany excellent characteristics that can be utilized su ccessfully for so many types of structures.\\nIn fact, they are often used together in the same structures with wonderful results.\\nThe selection of the structural material to be used for a particular building depends on\\nthe height and span of the structure, the material market, foundation conditions, local building\\ncodes, and architectural considerations. For buildings of less than 4 stories, reinforced concrete,\\nstructural steel, and wall-bearing construction are competitive. From 4 to about 20 stories,\\nreinforced concrete and structural steel are economically competitive, with steel having been\\nused in most of the jobs above 20 stories in the past. Today, however, reinforced concrete\\nis becoming increasingly competitive above 20 stories, and there are a number of reinforced\\nconcrete buildings of greater height around the world. The 74-story, 859-ft-high Water Tower\\nPlace in Chicago is the tallest reinforced concrete building in the world. The 1465-ft CN tower\\n(not a building) in Toronto, Canada, is the tallest reinforced concrete structure in the world.\\n8 Wang, C. K. and Salmon, C. G., 1998, Reinforced Concrete Design, 6th ed. (New Y ork: HarperCollins), pp. 3–5.\\n9 “The Story of Cement, Concrete and Reinforced Concrete,” Civil Engineering, November 1977, pp. 63–65.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 25}, page_content='McCormac c01.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 2:57 P.M. Page 6\\n6 CHAPTER 1 Introduction\\nAlthough we would all like to be involved in the design of tall, prestigious reinforced\\nconcrete buildings, there are just not enough of them to go around. As a result, nearly all of\\nour work involves much smaller structures. Perhaps 9 out of 10 buildings in the United States\\nare 3 stories or fewer in height, and more than two-thirds of them contain 15,000 sq ft or less\\nof ﬂoor space.\\nFoundation conditions can often affect the selection of the material to be used for the\\nstructural frame. If foundation conditions are poor, using a lighter structural steel frame may\\nbe desirable. The building code in a particular city may favor one material over the other.\\nFor instance, many cities have ﬁre zones in which only ﬁreproof structures can be erected—a\\nvery favorable situation for reinforced concrete. Finally, the time element favors structural steel\\nframes, as they can be erected more quickly than reinforced concrete ones. The time advantage,\\nhowever, is not as great as it might seem at ﬁrst because, if the structure is to have any type\\nof ﬁre rating, the builder will have to cover the steel with some kind of ﬁreprooﬁng material\\nafter it is erected.\\nMaking decisions about using concrete or steel for a bridge involves several factors,\\nsuch as span, foundation conditions, loads, architectural considerations, and others. In general,\\nconcrete is an excellent compression material and normally will be favored for short-span\\nbridges and for cases where rigidity is required (as, perhaps, for railway bridges).\\n1.6 Compatibility of Concrete and Steel\\nConcrete and steel reinforcing work together beautifully in reinforced concrete structures. The\\nadvantages of each material seem to compensate for the disadvantages of the other. For instance,\\nthe great shortcoming of concrete is its lack of tensile strength, but tensile strength is one of\\nthe great advantages of steel. Reinforcing bars have tensile strengths equal to approximately\\n100 times that of the usual concretes used.\\nThe two materials bond together very well so there is little chance of slippage between\\nthe two; thus, they will act together as a unit in resisting forces. The excellent bond obtained\\nis the result of the chemical adhesion between the two materials, the natural roughness of the\\nbars, and the closely spaced rib-shaped deformations rolled onto the bars’ surfaces.\\nReinforcing bars are subject to corrosion, but the concrete surrounding them provides\\nthem with excellent protection. The strength of exposed steel subjected to the temperatures\\nreached in ﬁres of ordinary intensity is nil, but enclosing the reinforcing steel in concrete\\nproduces very satisfactory ﬁre ratings. Finally, concrete and steel work well together in relation\\nto temperature changes because their coefﬁcients of thermal expansion are quite close. For steel,\\nthe coefﬁcient is 0.0000065 per unit length per degree Fahrenheit, while it varies for concrete\\nfrom about 0.000004 to 0.000007 (average value: 0.0000055).\\n1.7 Design Codes\\nThe most important code in the United States for reinforced concrete design is the American\\nConcrete Institute’s Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete (ACI 318-11).10 This\\ncode, which is used primarily for the design of buildings, is followed for the majority of the\\nnumerical examples given in this text. Frequent references are made to this document, and\\nsection numbers are provided. Design requirements for various types of reinforced concrete\\nmembers are presented in the code along with a “commentary” on those requirements. The com-\\nmentary provides explanations, suggestions, and additional information concerning the design\\nrequirements. As a result, users will obtain a better background and understanding of the code.\\n10 American Concrete Institute, 2011, Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete (ACI 318-11), Farmington Hills,\\nMichigan.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 26}, page_content='McCormac c01.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 2:57 P.M. Page 7\\n1.9 Types of Portland Cement 7\\nThe ACI Code is not in itself a legally enforceable document. It is merely a statement\\nof current good practice in reinforced concrete design. It is, however, written in the form of\\na code or law so that various public bodies, such as city councils, can easily vote it into their\\nlocal building codes, and then it becomes legally enforceable in that area. In this manner, the\\nACI Code has been incorporated into law by countless government organizations throughout\\nthe United States. The International Building Code (IBC), which was ﬁrst published in 2000\\nby the International Code Council, has consolidated the three regional building codes (Building\\nOfﬁcials and Code Administrators, International Conference of Building Ofﬁcials, and Southern\\nBuilding Code Congress International) into one national document. The IBC Code is updated\\nevery three years and refers to the most recent ed ition of ACI 318 for most of its provisions\\nrelated to reinforced concrete design, with only a few modiﬁcations. It is expected that IBC\\n2012 will refer to ACI 318-11 for most of its reinforced concrete provisions. The ACI 318\\nCode is also widely accepted in Canada and Mexico and has had treme ndous inﬂuence on the\\nconcrete codes of all countries throughout the world.\\nAs more knowledge is obtained pertaining to the behavior of reinforced concrete, the\\nACI revises its code. The present objective is to make yearly changes in the code in the form\\nof supplements and to provide major revisions of the entire code every three years.\\nOther well-known reinforced concrete speciﬁcations are those of the American Associ-\\nation of State Highway and Transportation Ofﬁcials (AASHTO) and the American Railway\\nEngineering Association (AREA).\\n1.8 SI Units and Shaded Areas\\nMost of this book is devoted to the design of reinforced concrete structures using U.S.\\ncustomary units. The authors, however, feel that it is absolutely necessary for today’s\\nengineer to be able to design in either customary or SI units. Thus, SI equations, where\\ndifferent from those in customary units, are presented herein, along with quite a few\\nnumerical examples using SI units. The equations are taken from the American Concrete\\nInstitute’s metric version ofBuilding Code Requirements for Structural Concrete (ACI\\n318M-11).11\\nFor many people it is rather distracting to read a book in which numbers, equations,\\nand so on are presented in two sets of units. To try to reduce this annoyance, the authors\\nhave placed a shaded area around any items pertaining to SI units throughout the text.\\nIf readers are working at a particular time with customary units, they can completely\\nignore the shaded areas. It is hoped, however, that the same shaded areas will enable a\\nperson working with SI units to easily ﬁnd appropriate equations, examples, and so on.\\n1.9 Types of Portland Cement\\nConcretes made with normal portland cement require about 2 weeks to achieve a sufﬁcient\\nstrength to permit the removal of forms and the application of moderate loads. Such concretes\\nreach their design strengths after about 28 days and continue to gain strength at a slower rate\\nthereafter.\\n11 Ibid.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 27}, page_content='McCormac c01.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 2:57 P.M. Page 8\\n8 CHAPTER 1 Introduction\\nCourtesy of Portland Cement Association.\\nOne Peachtree Center in Atlanta, Georgia, is 854 ft high; built for\\nthe 1996 Olympics.\\nOn many occasions it is desirable to speed up construction by using high-early-strength\\ncements, which, although more expensive, enable us to obtain desired strengths in 3 to 7\\ndays rather than the normal 28 days. These cements are particularly useful for the fabrication\\nof precast members, in which the concrete is placed in forms where it quickly gains desired\\nstrengths and is then removed from the forms and the forms are used to produce more members.\\nObviously, the quicker the desired strength is obtained, the more efﬁcient the operation. A\\nsimilar case can be made for the forming of concrete buildings ﬂoor by ﬂoor. High-early-\\nstrength cements can also be used advantageously for emergency repairs of concrete and for\\nshotcreting(where a mortar or concrete is blown through a hose at a high velocity onto a\\nprepared surface).\\nThere are other special types of portland cements available. The chemical process that\\noccurs during the setting or hardening of concrete produces heat. For very massive concrete\\nstructures such as dams, mat foundations, and piers, the heat will dissipate very slowly and can\\ncause serious problems. It will cause the concrete to expand during hydration. When cooling,\\nthe concrete will shrink and severe cracking will often occur.\\nConcrete may be used where it is exposed to various chlorides and/or sulfates. Such\\nsituations occur in seawater construction and for structures exposed to various types of soil.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 28}, page_content='McCormac c01.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 2:57 P.M. Page 9\\n1.10 Admixtures 9\\nSome portland cements are manufactured that have lower heat of hydration, and others are\\nmanufactured with greater resistance to attack by chlorides and sulfates.\\nIn the United States, the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) recognizes\\nﬁve types of portland cement. These different cements are manufactured from just about the\\nsame raw materials, but their properties are changed by using various blends of those materials.\\nType I cement is the normal cement used for most construction, but four other types are useful\\nfor special situations in which high early strength or low heat or sulfate resistance is needed:\\nType I—The common, all-purpose cement used for general construction work.\\nType II—A modiﬁed cement that has a lower heat of hydration than does Type I cement\\nand that can withstand some exposure to sulfate attack.\\nType III—A high-early-strength cement that will produce in the ﬁrst 24 hours a concrete\\nwith a strength about twice that of Type I cement. This cement does have a much\\nhigher heat of hydration.\\nType IV—A low-heat cement that pr oduces a concrete which generates heat very slowly.\\nIt is used for very large concrete structures.\\nType V—A cement used for concretes that are to be exposed to high concentrations of\\nsulfate.\\nShould the desired type of cement not be available, various admixtures may be purchased\\nwith which the properties of Type I cement can be modiﬁed to produce the desired effect.\\n1.10 Admixtures\\nMaterials added to concrete during or before mixing are referred to as admixtures. They are\\nused to improve the performance of concrete in certain situations as well as to lower its cost.\\nThere is a rather well-known saying regarding admixtures, to the effect that they are to concrete\\nas beauty aids are to the popul ace. Several of the most common types of admixtures are listed\\nand brieﬂy described here.\\n• Air-entraining admixtures, conforming to the requirements of ASTM C260 and C618, are\\nused primarily to increase concrete’s resistance to freezing and thawing and provide better\\nresistance to the deteriorating action of deicing salts. The air-entraining agents cause the\\nmixing water to foam, with the result that billions of closely spaced air bubbles are\\nincorporated into the concrete. When concrete freezes, water moves into the air bubbles,\\nrelieving the pressure in the concrete. When the concrete thaws, the water can move out\\nof the bubbles, with the result that there is less cracking than if air entrainment had not\\nbeen used.\\n• The addition of accelerating admixtures, such as calcium chloride, to concrete will accel-\\nerate its early strength development. The results of such additions (particularly useful\\nin cold climates) are reduced times required for curing and protection of the concrete\\nand the earlier removal of forms. (Section 3.6.3 of the ACI Code states that because\\nof corrosion problems, calcium chloride may not be added to concretes with embedded\\naluminum, concretes cast against stay-in-place galvanized steel forms, or prestressed con-\\ncretes.) Other accelerating admixtures that may be used include various soluble salts as\\nwell as some other organic compounds.\\n• Retarding admixturesare used to slow the setting of the concrete and to retard temperature\\nincreases. They consist of various acids or sugars or sugar derivatives. Some concrete\\ntruck drivers keep sacks of sugar on hand to throw into the concrete in case they get'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 29}, page_content='McCormac c01.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 2:57 P.M. Page 10\\n10 CHAPTER 1 Introduction\\ncaught in trafﬁc jams or are otherwise delayed. Retarding admixtures are particularly\\nuseful for large pours where signiﬁcant temperature increases may occur. They also\\nprolong the plasticity of the concrete, enabling better blending or bonding of su ccessive\\npours. Retarders can also slow the hydration of cement on exposed concrete surf aces or\\nformed surfaces to pr oduce attractive exposed aggregate ﬁnishes.\\n• Superplasticizers are admixtures made from organic sulfonates. Their use enables engi-\\nneers to reduce the water content in concretes substantially while at the same time\\nincreasing their slumps. Although superplasticizers can also be used to keep water–cement\\nratios constant while using less cement, they are more commonly used to produce work-\\nable concretes with considerably higher strengths while using the same amount of cement.\\n(See Section 1.13.) A relatively new product, self-consolidating concrete, uses superplas-\\nticizers and modiﬁcations in mix designs to produce an extremely workable mix that\\nrequires no vibration, even for the most congested pl acement situations.\\n• Waterprooﬁng materials usually are applied to hardened concrete surfaces, but they may\\nbe added to concrete mixes. These admixtures generally consist of some type of soap or\\npetroleum products, as perhaps asphalt emulsions. They may help retard the penetration\\nof water into porous concretes but probably don’t help dense, well-cured concretes very\\nmuch.\\n1.11 Properties of Concrete\\nA thorough knowledge of the properties of concrete is necessary for the student before he or she\\nbegins to design reinforced concrete structures. An introduction to several of these properties\\nis presented in this section.\\nCompressive Strength\\nThe compressive strength of concrete, f ′\\nc , is determined by testing to failure 28-day-old 6-in.\\ndiameter by 12-in. concrete cylinders at a speciﬁed rate of loading (4-in. diameter by 8-in.\\ncylinders were ﬁrst permitted in the 2008 code in lieu of the larger cylinders). For the 28-day\\nperiod, the cylinders are usually kept under water or in a room with constant temperature\\nand 100% humidity. Although concretes are available with 28-day ultimate strengths from\\n2500 psi up to as high as 10,000 psi to 20,000 psi, most of the concretes used fall into the\\n3000-psi to 7000-psi range. For ordinary applications, 3000-psi and 4000-psi concretes are\\nused, whereas for prestressed construction, 5000-psi and 6000-psi strengths are common. For\\nsome applications, such as for the columns of the lower stories of high-rise buildings, concretes\\nwith strengths up to 9000 psi or 10,000 psi have been used and can be furnished by ready-\\nmix companies. As a result, the use of such high-strength concretes is becoming increasingly\\ncommon. At Two Union Square in Seattle, concrete with strengths up to 19,000 psi was used.\\nThe values obtained for the compressive strength of concretes, as determined by testing,\\nare to a considerable degree dependent on the sizes and shapes of the test units and the\\nmanner in which they are loaded. In many countries, the test specimens are cubes, 200 mm\\n(7.87 in.) on each side. For the same batches of concrete, the testing of 6-in. by 12-in. cylinders\\nprovides compressive strengths only equal to about 80% of the values in psi determined with\\nthe cubes.\\nIt is quite feasible to move from 3000-psi concrete to 5000-psi concrete without requiring\\nexcessive amounts of labor or cement. The approximate increase in material cost for such a\\nstrength increase is 15% to 20%. To move above 5000-psi or 6000-psi concrete, however,\\nrequires very careful mix designs and considerable attention to such details as mixing, placing,\\nand curing. These requirements cause relatively larger increases in cost.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 30}, page_content='McCormac c01.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 2:57 P.M. Page 11\\n1.11 Properties of Concrete 11\\nSeveral comments are made throughout the text regarding the relative economy of using\\ndifferent strength concretes for different applications, such as those for beams, columns, foot-\\nings, and prestressed members.\\nTo ensure that the compressive strength of concrete in the structure is at least as strong as\\nthe speciﬁed value, f ′\\nc , the design of the concrete mix must target a higher value, f ′\\ncr . Section\\n5.3 of the ACI Code requires that the concrete compressive strengths used as a basis for\\nselecting the concrete proportions ex ceed the speciﬁed 28-day strengths by fairly large values.\\nFor concrete production facilities that have sufﬁcient ﬁeld strength test records not older than\\n24 months to enable them to calculate satisfactory standard deviations (as described in ACI\\nSection 5.3.1.1), a set of required average compressive strengths(f ′\\ncr ) to be used as the basis\\nfor selecting concrete properties is speciﬁed in ACI Table 5.3.2.1. For facilities that do not\\nhave sufﬁcient records to calculate satisfactory standard deviations, ACI Table 5.3.2.2 pro-\\nvides increases in required average design compressive strength(f ′\\ncr ) of 1000 psi for speciﬁed\\nconcrete strength (f ′\\nc ) of less than 3000 psi and appreciably higher increases for higher f ′\\nc\\nconcretes.\\nThe stress–strain curves of Figure 1.1 represent the results obtained from compression\\ntests of sets of 28-day-old standard cylinders of varying strengths. You should carefully study\\nthese curves because they bring out several signiﬁcant points:\\n(a) The curves are roughly straight while the load is increased from zero to about one-third\\nto one-half the concrete’s ultimate strength.\\n(b) Beyond this range the behavior of concrete is nonlinear. This lack of linearity of concrete\\nstress–strain curves at higher stresses causes some problems in the structural analysis of\\nconcrete structures because their behavior is alsononlinear at higher stresses.\\n(c) Of particular importance is the fact that regardless of strengths, all the concretes reach\\ntheir ultimate strengths at strains of about 0.002.\\n(d) Concrete does not have a deﬁnite yield strength; rather, the curves run smoothly on\\nto the point of rupture at strains of from 0.003 to 0.004. It will be assumed for the\\npurpose of future calculations in this text that concrete fails at 0.003 (ACI 10.2.3).

Its value varies with different concrete\\nstrengths, concrete age, type of loading, and the characteristics and proportions of the cement\\nand aggregates. Furthermore, there are several different deﬁnitions of the modulus:\\n(a) The initial modulus is the slope of the stress–strain diagram at the origin of the curve.\\n(b) The tangent modulus is the slope of a tangent to the curve at some point along the\\ncurve—for instance, at 50% of the ultimate strength of the concrete.\\n(c) The slope of a line drawn from the origin to a point on the curve somewhere between\\n25% and 50% of its ultimate compressive strength is referred to as a secant modulus.\\n(d) Another modulus, called the apparent modulus or the long-term modulus, is determined\\nby using the stresses and strains obtained after the load has been applied for a certain\\nlength of time.\\nSection 8.5.1 of the ACI Code states that the following expression can be used for\\ncalculating the modulus of elasticity of concretes weighing from 90 lb/ft 3 to 155 lb/ft 3:\\nEc = w1.5\\nc 33\\n√\\nf ′c\\nIn this expression, Ec is the modulus of elasticity in psi, wc is the weight of the concrete in\\npounds per cubic foot, and f ′\\nc is its speciﬁed 28-day compressive strength in psi. This is actually\\na secant m odulus with the line (whose slope equals the modulus) drawn from the origin to a\\npoint on the stress–strain curve corresponding approximately to the stress (0.45f ′\\nc ) that would\\noccur under the estimated dead and live loads the structure must support.\\nFor normal-weight concrete weighing approximately 145 lb/ft 3, the ACI Code states that\\nthe following simpliﬁed version of the previous expression may be used to determine the\\nmodulus:\\nEc = 57,000\\n√\\nf ′c\\nTable A.1 (see Appendix A at the end of the book) shows values of Ec for different\\nstrength concretes having normal-weight aggregate. These values were calculated with the ﬁrst\\nof the preceding formulas assuming 145 lb/ft 3 concrete.\\n12 MacGregor, J. G. and Wight, J. K., 2005, Reinforced Concrete Mechanics and Design , 4th ed.

The mass of a particular object is the same anywhere on Earth, whereas the\\nweight of an object in our customary units varies depending on altitude b ecause of the\\nchange in gravitational acceleration.\\nConcretes with strength above 6000 psi are referred to as high-strength concretes. Tests\\nhave indicated that the usual ACI equations for Ec when applied to high-strength concretes\\nresult in values that are too large. Based on studies at Cornell University, the expression to\\nfollow has been recommended for normal-weight concretes with f ′\\nc values greater than 6000 psi\\nand up to 12,000 psi and for lightweight concretes with f ′\\nc greater than 6000 psi and up to\\n9000 psi.13,14\\nEc(psi) =\\n[\\n40,000\\n√\\nf ′c + 106\\n](wc\\n145\\n⎡1.5\\nIn SI units with f ′\\nc in MPa and wc in kg/m3, the expression is\\nEc(MPa) =\\n[\\n3.32\\n√\\nf ′c + 6895\\n](wc\\n2320\\n⎡1.5\\nDynamic Modulus of Elasticity\\nThe dynamic modulus of elasticity, which corresponds to very small instantaneous strains, is\\nusually obtained by sonic tests. It is generally 20% to 40% higher than the static modulus and\\nis approximately equal to the initial modulus. When structures are being analyzed for seismic\\nor impact loads, the use of the dynamic modulus seems appropriate.\\nPoisson’s Ratio\\nAs a concrete cylinder is subjected to compressive loads, it not only shortens in length but also\\nexpands laterally. The ratio of this lateral expansion to the longitudinal shortening is referred\\nto as Poisson’s ratio. Its value varies from about 0.11 for the higher-strength concretes to as\\nhigh as 0.21 for the weaker-grade concretes, with average values of about 0.16. There does\\nnot seem to be any direct relationship between the value of the ratio and the values of items\\nsuch as the water–cement ratio, amount of curing, aggregate size, and so on.\\n13 Nawy, E.

It may very well have to be considered, however, in the analysis and design of arch\\ndams, tunnels, and some other statically indeterminate structures. Spiral reinforcing in columns\\ntakes advantage of Poisson’s ratio and will be discussed in Chapter 9.\\nShrinkage\\nWhen the materials for concrete are mixed, the paste consisting of cement and water ﬁlls\\nthe voids between the aggregate and bonds the aggregate together. This mixture needs to be\\nsufﬁciently workable or ﬂuid so that it can be made to ﬂow in between the reinforcing bars and\\nall through the forms. To achieve this desired workability, considerably more water (perhaps\\ntwice as much) is used than is necessary for the cement and water to react (calledhydration).\\nAfter the concrete has been cured and begins to dry, the extra mixing water that was\\nused begins to work its way out of the concrete to the surface, where it evaporates. As a result,\\nthe concrete shrinks and cracks. The resulting cracks may reduce the shear strength of the\\nmembers and be detrimental to the appearance of the structure. In addition, the cracks may\\npermit the reinforcing to be exposed to the atmosphere or chemicals, such as deicers, thereby\\nincreasing the possibility of corrosion. Shrinkage continues for many years, but under ordinary\\nconditions probably about 90% of it occurs during the ﬁrst year. The amount of moisture that\\nis lost varies with the distance from the surface. Furthermore, the larger the surface area of\\na member in proportion to its volume, the larger the rate of shrinkage; that is, members with\\nsmall cross sections shrink more proportionately than do those with large cross sections.\\nThe amount of shrinkage is heavily dependent on the type of exposure. For instance, if\\nconcrete is subjected to a considerable amount of wind during curing, its shrinkage will be\\ngreater. In a related fashion, a humid atmosphere means less shrinkage, whereas a dry one\\nmeans more.\\nIt should also be realized that it is desirable to use low-absorptive aggregates such as those\\nfrom granite and many limestones. When certain absorptive slates and sandstone aggregates are\\nused, the result may be one and a half or even two times the shrinkage with other aggregates.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 34}, page_content='McCormac c01.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 2:57 P.M. Page 15\\n1.11 Properties of Concrete 15\\nTo minimize shrinkage it is desirable to: (1) keep the amount of mixing water to a\\nminimum; (2) cure the concrete well; (3) place the concrete for walls, ﬂoors, and other large\\nitems in small sections (thus allowing some of the shrinkage to take place before the next\\nsection is placed); (4) use construction joints to control the position of cracks; (5) use shrinkage\\nreinforcement; and (6) use appropriate dense and nonporous aggregates. 15\\nCreep\\nUnder sustained compressive loads, concrete will continue to deform for long periods of time.\\nAfter the initial deformation occurs, the additional deformation is calledcreep, or plastic ﬂow.\\nIf a compressive load is applied to a concrete member, an immediate or instantaneous elastic\\nshortening occurs. If the load is left in place for a long time, the member will continue to shorten\\nover a period of several years, and the ﬁnal deformation will usually be two to three times the\\ninitial deformation. You will ﬁnd in Chapter 6 that this means that long-term deﬂections may\\nalso be as much as two or three times initial deﬂections. Perhaps 75% of the total creep will\\noccur during the ﬁrst year.\\nShould the long-term load be removed, the member will recover most of its elastic strain\\nand a little of its creep strain. If the load is repl aced, both the elastic and creep strains will\\nagain develop.\\nThe amount of creep is largely dependent on the amount of stress. It is almost directly\\nproportional to stress as long as the sustained stress is not greater than about one-half of f ′\\nc .\\nBeyond this level, creep will increase rapidly.\\nLong-term loads not only cause creep but also can adversely affect the strength of the\\nconcrete. For loads maintained on concentrically loaded specimens for a year or longer, there\\nmay be a strength reduction of perhaps 15% to 25%. Thus a member loaded with a sustained\\nload of, say, 85% of its ultimate compression strength , f ′\\nc , may very well be satisfactory for a\\nwhile but may fail later .16\\nSeveral other items affecting the amount of creep are:\\n• The longer the concrete cures before loads are applied, the smaller will be the creep.\\nSteam curing, which causes quicker strengthening, will also reduce creep.\\n• Higher-strength concretes have less creep than do lower-strength concretes stressed at the\\nsame values. However, applied stresses for higher-strength concretes are, in all probabil-\\nity, higher than those for lower-strength concretes, and this fact tends to cause increasing\\ncreep.\\n• Creep increases with higher temperatures. It is highest when the concrete is at about\\n150◦F to 160 ◦F.\\n• The higher the humidity, the smaller will be the free pore water that can escape from the\\nconcrete. Creep is almost twice as large at 50% humidity than at 100% humidity. It is\\nobviously quite difﬁcult to distinguish between shrinkage and creep.\\n• Concretes with the highest percentage of cement–water paste have the highest creep\\nbecause the paste, not the aggregate, does the creeping. This is particularly true if a\\nlimestone aggregate is used.\\n• Obviously, the addition of reinforcing to the compression areas of concrete will greatly\\nreduce creep because steel exhibits very little creep at ordinary stresses. As creep tends\\n15 Leet, K., 1991, Reinforced Concrete Design, 2nd ed.

A\\nmajor reason for this small strength is the fact that concrete is ﬁlled with ﬁne cracks. The\\ncracks have little effect when concrete is subjected to compression loads because the loads\\ncause the cracks to close and permit compression transfer. Obviously, this is not the case for\\ntensile loads.\\nAlthough tensile strength is normally neglected in design calculations, it is nevertheless\\nan important property that affects the sizes and extent of the cracks that occur. Furthermore,\\nthe tensile strength of concrete members has a deﬁnite reduction effect on their deﬂections.\\n(Because of the small tensile strength of concrete,little effort has been made to determine\\nits tensile modulus of elasticity. Based on this limited information, however, it seems that its\\nvalue is equal to its compression modulus.)\\nYou might wonder why concrete is not assumed to resist a portion of the tension in a\\nﬂexural member and the steel the remainder. The reason is that concrete cracks at such small\\ntensile strains that the low stresses in the steel up to that time would make its use uneconomical.\\nOnce tensile cracking has occurred, concrete has no more tensile strength.\\nThe tensile strength of concrete doesn’t vary in direct proportion to its ultimate compres-\\nsion strength, f ′\\nc . It does, however, vary approximately in proportion to the square root of f ′\\nc .\\nThis strength is quite difﬁcult to measure with direct axial tension loads because of problems\\nin gripping test specimens so as to avoid stress concentrations and because of difﬁcu lties in\\naligning the loads. As a result of these problems, two indirect tests have been developed to\\nmeasure concrete’s tensile strength. These are themodulus of rupture and the split-cylinder\\ntests.\\nThe tensile strength of concrete in ﬂexure is quite important when considering beam\\ncracks and deﬂections. For these considerations, the tensile strengths obtained with the modulus\\nof rupture test have long been used. The modulus of rupture (which is deﬁned as the ﬂexural\\ntensile strength of concrete) is usually measured by loading a 6-in.× 6-in. × 30-in. plain\\n(i.e., unreinforced) rectangular beam (with simple supports pl aced 24 in. on center) to failure\\nwith equal concentrated loads at its one-third points as per ASTM C78-2002. 17 The load is\\nincreased until failure occurs by cracking on the tensile face of the beam. The modulus of\\nrupture,fr, is then determined from the ﬂexure formula. In the following expressions, b is the\\nbeam width, h is its depth, and M is PL/6, which is the maximum computed moment:\\nfr = Mc\\nI = M (h/2)\\n1\\n12 bh3\\nfr = modulus of rupture = 6M\\nbh2 = PL\\nbh2\\n17 American Society for Testing and Materials, 2002, Standard T est Method for Flexural Strength of Concrete (Using Simple\\nBeam with Third-Point Loading) (ASTM C78-2002), West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 36}, page_content='McCormac c01.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 2:57 P.M.

This assumption is not very good.\\nBased on hundreds of tests, the code (Section 9.5.2.3) provides a modulus of rupture fr\\nequal to 7.5 λ\\n√\\nf ′c ,w h e r efr and f ′\\nc are in units of psi. 18 The λ term reduces the modulus of\\nrupture when lightweight aggregates are used (see Section 1.12).\\nThe tensile strength of concrete may also be measured with the split-cylinder test. 19\\nA cylinder is placed on its side in the testing machine, and a compressive load is applied\\nuniformly along the length of the cylinder, with support supplied along the bottom for the\\ncylinder’s full length (see Figure 1.2). The cylinder will split in half from end to end when its\\ntensile strength is reached. The tensile strength at which splitting occurs is referred to as the\\nsplit-cylinder strength and can be calculated with the following expression, in which P is the\\nmaximum compressive force, L is the length, and D is the diameter of the cylinder:\\nft = 2P\\nπLD\\nEven though pads are used under the loads, some local stress concentrations occur during\\nthe tests. In addition, some stresses develop at right angles to the tension stresses. As a result,\\nthe tensile strengths obtained are not very accurate.\\nShear Strength\\nIt is extremely difﬁcult in laboratory testing to obtain pure shear failures unaffected by other\\nstresses.

You will\\nlearn in Chapter 8 that you do not have to worry about these inconsistent shear strength tests\\nbecause design approaches are based on very conservative assumptions of that strength.\\n1.12 Aggregates\\nThe aggregates used in concrete occupy about three-fourths of the concrete volume. Since\\nthey are less expensive than the cement, it is desirable to use as much of them as possible.\\nBoth ﬁne aggregates (usually sand) and coarse aggregates (usually gravel or crushed stone)\\nare used. Any aggregate that passes a No. 4 sieve (which has wires spaced 1\\n4 in. on centers in\\neach direction) is said to be ﬁne aggregate. Material of a larger size is coarse aggregate.\\nThe maximum-size aggregates that can be used in reinforced concrete are speciﬁed in\\nSection 3.3.2 of the ACI Code. These limiting values are as follows: one-ﬁfth of the narrowest\\ndimensions between the sides of the forms, one-third of the depth of slabs, or three-quarters of\\nthe minimum clear spacing between reinforcing . Larger sizes may be used if, in the judgment\\nof the engineer, the workability of the concrete and its method of consolidation are such that\\nthe aggregate used will not cause the development of honeycomb or voids.\\nAggregates must be strong, durable, and clean. Should dust or other particles be present,\\nthey may interfere with the bond between the cement paste and the aggregate. The strength\\nof the aggregate has an important effect on the strength of the concrete, and the aggregate\\nproperties greatly affect the concrete’s durability.\\nConcretes that have 28-day strengths equal to or greater than 2500 psi and air-dry weights\\nequal to or less than 115 lb/ft 3 are said to be structural lightweight concretes. The aggregates\\nused for these concretes are made from expanded shales of volcanic origin, ﬁred clays, or\\nslag. When lightweight aggregates are used for both ﬁne and coarse aggregate, the result is\\ncalledall-lightweight concrete. If sand is used for ﬁne aggregate and if the coarse aggregate\\nis replaced with lightweight aggregate, the result is referred to as sand-lightweight concrete.\\nConcretes made with lightweight aggregates may not be as durable or tough as those made\\nwith normal-weight aggregates.\\nSome of the structural properties of concrete are affected by the use of lightweight\\naggregates. ACI 318-11 Section 8.4 requires that the modulus of rupture be reduced by the\\nintroduction of the term λ in the equation\\nfr = 7.5λ\\n√\\nf ′c (ACI Equation 9-10)\\nor, in SI units with f ′\\nc in N/mm2, fr = 0.7λ\\n√\\nf ′c\\nThe value of λ depends on the aggregate that is replaced with lightweight material. If only the\\ncoarse aggregate is replaced (sand-lightweight concrete), λ is 0.85. If the sand is also replaced\\nwith lightweight material (all-lightweight concrete), λ is 0.75. Linear interpolation is permitted\\nbetween the values of 0.85 and 1.0 as well as from 0.75 to 0.85 when partial replacement\\nwith lightweight material is used. Alternatively, if the average splitting tensile strength of\\nlightweight concrete,fct, is speciﬁed, ACI 318-11 Section 8.6.1 deﬁnes λ as\\nλ = fct\\n6.7\\n√\\nf ′c\\n≤ 1.0\\nFor normal-weight concrete and for concrete having normal-weight ﬁne aggregate and a blend\\nof lightweight and normal-weight coarse aggregate, λ = 1.0. Use of lightweight aggregate\\nconcrete can affect beam deﬂections, shear strength, coefﬁcient of friction, development lengths\\nof reinforcing bars and hooked bars, and prestressed concrete design.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 38}, page_content='McCormac c01.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 2:57 P.M. Page 19\\n1.13 High-Strength Concretes 19\\n1.13 High-Strength Concretes\\nConcretes with compression strengths exceeding 6000 psi are referred to as high-strength\\nconcretes. Another name sometimes given to them is high-performance concretes because\\nthey have other excellent characteristics besides just high strengths. For instance, the low\\npermeability of such concretes causes them to be quite durable as regards the various physical\\nand chemical agents acting on them that may cause the material to deteriorate.\\nUp until a few decades ago, structural designers felt that ready-mix companies could\\nnot deliver concretes with compressive strengths much higher than 4000 psi or 5000 psi.\\nThis situation, however, is no longer the case as these same companies can today deliver\\nconcretes with compressive strengths up to at least 9000 psi. Even stronger concretes than\\nthese have been used. At Two Union Square in Seattle, 19,000-psi concrete was obtained\\nusing ready-mix concrete delivered to the site. Furthermore, concretes have been produced in\\nlaboratories with strengths higher than 20,000 psi. Perhaps these latter concretes should be\\ncalled super-high-strength concretes or super-high-performance concretes.\\nIf we are going to use a very high-strength cement paste, we must not forget to use a\\ncoarse aggregate that is equally as strong. If the planned concrete strength is, say, 15,000 psi\\nto 20,000 psi, equally strong aggregate must be used, and such aggregate may very well not\\nbe available within reasonable distances. In addition to the strengths needed for the coarse\\naggregate, their sizes should be well graded, and their surf aces should be rough so that better\\nbonding to the cement paste will be obtained. The rough surf aces of aggregates, however, may\\ndecrease the concrete’s workability.\\nFrom an economical standpoint, you should realize that though concretes with 12,000-\\npsi to 15,000-psi strengths cost approximately three times as much to produce as do 3000-psi\\nconcretes, their compressive strengths are four to ﬁve times as large.\\nHigh-strength concretes are sometimes used for both precast and prestressed members.\\nThey are particularly useful in the precast i ndustry where their strength enables us to produce\\nsmaller and lighter members, with consequent savings in storage, handling, shipping, and\\nerection costs. In addition, they have sometimes been used for offshore structures, but their\\ncommon use has been for columns of tall reinforced concrete buildings, probably over 25 to\\n30 stories in height where the column loads are very large, say, 1000 kips or more. Actually,\\nfor such buildings, the columns for the upper ﬂoors, where the loads are relatively small, are\\nprobably constructed with conventional 4000-psi or 5000-psi concretes, while high-strength\\nconcretes are used for the lower heavily loaded columns. If conventional concretes were used\\nfor these lower columns, the columns could very well become so large that they would occupy\\nexcessive amounts of rentable ﬂoor sp ace. High-strength concretes are also of advantage in\\nconstructing shear walls. (Shear walls are discussed in Chapter 18.)\\nTo produce concretes with strengths above 6000 psi, it is ﬁrst n ecessary to use more\\nstringent quality control of the work and to exercise special care in the selection of the mate-\\nrials to be used. Strength increases can be made by using lower water–cement ratios, adding\\nadmixtures, and selecting good clean and solid aggregates. The actual concrete strengths used\\nby the designer for a particular job will depend on the size of the loads and the quality of the\\naggregate available.\\nIn recent years, appreciable improvements have been made in the placing, vibrating,\\nand ﬁnishing of concrete. These improvements have resulted in lower water–cement ratios\\nand, thus, higher strengths. The most important factor affecting the strength of concrete is its\\nporosity, which is controlled primarily by the water–cement ratio. This ratio should be kept\\nas small as possible as long as adequate workability is maintained. In this regard, there are\\nvarious water-reducing admixtures with which the ratios can be appreciably reduced, while at\\nthe same time maintaining suitable workability.\\nConcretes with strengths from 6000 psi to 10,000 psi or 12,000 psi can easily be obtained\\nif admixtures such as silica fume and superplasticizers are used.

It is obtained from electric arc furnaces as a by-\\nproduct during the production of metallic silicon and various other silicon alloys. It is available\\nin both powder and liquid form. The amount of silica fume used in a mix varies from 5% to\\n30% of the weight of the cement.\\nSilica fume particles have diameters approximately 100 times smaller than the average\\ncement particle, and their surface areas per unit of weight are roughly 40 to 60 times those\\nof portland cement. As a result, they hold more water. (By the way, this increase of surface\\narea causes the generation of more heat of hydration.) The water–cement ratios are smaller,\\nand strengths are higher. Silica fume is a pozzolan: a siliceous material that by itself has no\\ncementing quality, but when used in concrete mixes its extraordinarily ﬁne particles r eact with\\nthe calcium hydroxide in the cement to produce a cementious compound. Quite a few pozzolans\\nare available that can be used satisfactorily in concrete. Two of the most common ones are ﬂy\\nash and silica fume. Here, only silica fume is discussed.\\nWhen silica fume is used, it causes increases in the density and strength of the concrete.\\nThese improvements are due to the fact that the ultraﬁne silica fume particles are dispersed\\nbetween the cement particles. Unfortunately, this causes a reduction in the workability of the\\nconcrete, and it is necessary to add superplasticizers to the mix. Superplasticizers, also called\\nhigh-range water reducers, are added to concretes to increase their workability. They are made\\nby treating formaldehyde or napthaline with sulfuric acid. Such materials used as admixtures\\nlower the viscosity or resistance to ﬂow of the concrete. As a result, less water can be used,\\nthus yielding lower water–cement ratios and higher strengths.\\nOrganic polymers can be used to replace a part of the cement as the binder. An organic\\npolymer is composed of molecules that have been formed by the union of thousands of\\nmolecules. The most commonly used polymers in concrete are latexes. Such additives improve\\nconcrete’s strength, durability, and adhesion. In addition, the resulting concretes have excellent\\nresistance to abrasion, freezing, thawing, and impact.\\nAnother procedure that can increase the strength of concrete is consolidation.W h e np r e -\\ncast concrete products are consolidated, excess water and air are squ eezed out, thus pr oducing\\nconcretes with optimum air contents. In a similar manner, the centrifugal forces caused by the\\nspinning of concrete pipes during their manufacture consolidate the concrete and reduce the\\nwater and air contents. Not much work has been done in the consolidation area for cast-in-place\\nconcrete because of the difﬁculty of applying the squeezing forces. To squeeze such concretes,\\nit is necessary to apply pressure to the forms. One major difﬁculty in doing this is that very\\nspecial care must be used to prevent distortion of the wet concrete members.\\n1.14 Fiber-Reinforced Concretes\\nIn recent years, a great deal of interest has been shown in ﬁbe r-reinforced concrete, and today\\nthere is much ongoing research on the subject. The ﬁbers used are made from steel, plastics,\\nglass, and other materials. V arious experiments have shown that the addition of such ﬁbers in\\nconvenient quantities (normally up to about 1% or 2% by volume) to conventional concretes\\ncan appreciably improve their characteristics.\\nThe compressive strengths of ﬁber-reinforced concretes are not signiﬁcantly greater than\\nthey would be if the same mixes were used without the ﬁbers. The resulting concretes, however,\\nare substantially tougher and have greater resistance to cracking and higher impact resistance.\\nThe use of ﬁbers has increased the versatility of concrete by reducing its brittleness. The reader\\nshould note that a reinforcing bar provides reinforcing only in the direction of the bar, while\\nrandomly distributed ﬁbers provide additional strength in all directions.\\nSteel is the most commonly used material for the ﬁbers. The resulting concretes seem\\nto be quite durable, at least as long as the ﬁbers are covered and protected by the cement'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 40}, page_content='McCormac c01.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 2:57 P.M.

Concretes reinforced with steel ﬁbers are most often used in pavements, thin shells,\\nand precast pr oducts as well as in various patches and overlays. Glass ﬁbers are more often\\nused for spray-on applications as in shotcrete. It is necessary to realize that ordinary glass will\\ndeteriorate when in contact with cement paste. As a result, using alkali-resistant glass ﬁbers is\\nnecessary.\\nThe ﬁbers used vary in length from about 0.25 in. up to about 3 in. while their diameters\\nrun from approximately 0.01 in. to 0.03 in. For improving the bond with the cement paste, the\\nﬁbers can be hooked or crimped. In addition, the surface characteristics of the ﬁbers can be\\nchemically modiﬁed in order to increase bonding.\\nThe improvement obtained in the toughness of the concrete (the total energy absorbed\\nin breaking a member in ﬂexure) by adding ﬁbers is dependent on the ﬁbers’ aspect ratio\\n(length/diameter). Typically, the aspect ratios used vary from about 25 up to as much as 150,\\nwith 100 being about an average value. Other factors affecting toughness are the shape and\\ntexture of the ﬁbers. ASTM C1018 20 is the test method for determining the toughness of\\nﬁber-reinforced concrete using the third-point beam-loading method described earlier.\\nWhen a crack opens up in a ﬁber-reinforced concrete member, the few ﬁbers bridging\\nthe crack do not appreciably increase the strength of the concrete. They will, however, provide\\nresistance to the opening up of the crack because of the considerable work that would be\\nnecessary to pull them out. As a result, the ductility and toughness of the concrete is increased.\\nThe use of ﬁbers has been shown to increase the fatigue life of beams and lessen the widths\\nof cracks when members are subject to fatigue loadings.\\nThe use of ﬁbers does signiﬁcantly increase costs. It is probably for this reason that ﬁber-\\nreinforced concretes have been used for overlays for highway pavements and airport runways\\nrather than for whole concrete projects. Actually in the long run, if the increased service lives of\\nﬁber-reinforced concretes are considered, they may very well prove to be quite cost-effective.\\nFor instance, many residential contractors use ﬁber-reinforced concrete to construct driveways\\ninstead of regular reinforced concrete.\\nSome people have the feeling that the addition of ﬁbers to concrete reduces its slump\\nand workability as well as its strength. Apparently, they feel this way b ecause the concrete\\nlooks stiffer to them. Actually, the ﬁbers do not reduce the slump unless the quantity is too\\ngreat—that is, much above about one pound per cubic yard. The ﬁbers only appear to cause\\na reduction in workability, but as a result concrete ﬁnishers will often add more water so that\\nwater-cement ratios are increased and strengths decreased. ASTM C1018 uses the third-point\\nbeam-loading method described earlier to measure the toughness and ﬁrst-crack strength of\\nﬁber-reinforced concrete.\\n1.15 Concrete Durability\\nThe compressive strength of concrete may be dictated by exposure to fr eeze-thaw conditions\\nor chemicals such as deicers or sulfates. These conditions may require a greater compressive\\nstrength or lower water–cement ratio than those required to carry the calculated loads. Chapter 4\\nof the 2008 code imposes limits on water–cement ratio, f ′\\nc , and entrained air for elements\\nexposed to fr eeze-thaw cycles. For concrete e xposed to deicing chemicals, the amount of ﬂy\\nash or other pozzolans is limited in this chapter. Finally, the water–cement ratio is limited by\\nexposure to sulfates as well. The designer is required to determine whether structural load-\\ncarrying requirements or durability requirements are more stringent and to specify the more\\nrestrictive requirements for f ′\\nc , water–cement ratio, and air content.\\n20 American Society for Testing and Materials, 1997, Standard T est Method for Flexural T oughness and First-Crack Strength\\nof Fiber-Reinforced Concrete (Using Simple Beam with Third-Point Loading) (ASTM C1018-1997), West Conshohocken,\\nPennsylvania.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 41}, page_content='McCormac c01.tex V2 - January 10, 2013 9:10 P.M. Page 22\\n22 CHAPTER 1 Introduction\\n1.16 Reinforcing Steel\\nThe reinforcing used for concrete structures may be in the form of bars or welded wire fabric.\\nReinforcing bars are referred to as plain or deformed. The deformed bars, which have ribbed\\nprojections rolled onto their surfaces (patterns differing with different manufacturers) to provide\\nbetter bonding between the concrete and the steel, are used for almost all applications. Instead\\nof rolled-on deformations, deformed wire has indentations pressed into it. Plain bars are not\\nused very often except for wrapping around l ongitudinal bars, primarily in columns.\\nPlain round bars are indicated by their diameters in fractions of an inch as 3i n .\\n8 φ, 1i n .\\n2 φ,\\nand 5i n .\\n8 φ. Deformed bars are round and vary in sizes from #3 to #11, with two very large sizes,\\n#14 and #18, also available. For bars up to and including #8, the number of the bar coincides\\nwith the bar diameter in eighths of an inch. For example, a #7 bar has a diameter of7\\n8 in. and a\\ncross-sectional area of 0.60 in. 2 (which is the area of a circle with a 7\\n8 -in. diameter). Bars were\\nformerly manufactured in both round and square cross sections, but today all bars are round.\\nThe #9, #10, and #11 bars have diameters that provide areas equal to the areas of the\\nold 1-in. × 1-in. square bars, 1 1\\n8 -in. × 11\\n8 -in. square bars, and 1 1\\n4 -in. × 11\\n4 -in. square bars,\\nrespectively. Similarly, the #14 and #18 bars correspond to the old 1 1\\n2 -in. × 1 1\\n2 -in. square bars\\nand 2-in. × 2-in. square bars, respectively.

Although #14 and #18 bars are shown in\\nthis table, the designer should check his or her suppliers to see if they have these very large\\nsizes in stock. Reinforcing bars may be purchased in lengths up to 60 ft. Longer bars have to\\nbe specially ordered. In general, longer bars are too ﬂexible and difﬁcult to handle.\\nWelded wire fabric is also frequently used for reinforcing slabs, pavements, and shells,\\nand places where there is normally not sufﬁcient room for providing the necessary concrete\\ncover required for regular reinforcing bars. The mesh is made of cold-drawn wires running\\nin both directions and welded together at the points of intersection. The sizes and spacings\\nof the wire may be the same in both directions or may be different, depending on design\\nrequirements. Wire mesh is easily placed and has excellent bond with the concrete, and the\\nspacing of the wires is well controlled.\\nTable A.3(A) in Appendix A provides information concerning certain styles of welded\\nwire fabric that have been recommended by the Wire Reinforcement Institute as common\\nstock styles (normally carried in stock at the mills or at warehousing points and, thus, usually\\nimmediately available). Table A.3(B) provides detailed information about diameters, areas,\\nweights, and spacings of quite a few wire sizes normally used to manufacture welded wire\\nfabric. Smooth and deformed wire fabric is made from wires whose diameters range from\\n0.134 in. to 0.628 in. for plain wire and from 0.225 in. to 0.628 in. for deformed wires.\\nSmooth wire is denoted by the letter W followed by a number that equals the cross-\\nsectional area of the wire in hundredths of a square inch. Deformed wire is denoted by the\\nletter D followed by a number giving the area. For instance, a D4 wire is a deformed wire\\nwith a cross-sectional area equal to 0.04 in. 2 Smooth wire fabric is actually included within\\nthe ACI Code’s deﬁnition of deformed reinforcement b ecause of its mechanical bonding to the\\nconcrete caused by the wire intersections. Wire fabric that actually has deformations on the\\nwire surfaces bonds even more to the concrete b ecause of the deformations as well as the wire\\nintersections. According to the code, deformed wire is not permitted to be larger than D31 or\\nsmaller than D4.\\nHeaded Steel Bars for Concrete Reinforcement (ASTM A970/970M) were added to\\nthe ACI 318 Code in 2008. Headed bars can be used instead of straight or hooked bars,\\nwith considerably less congestion in crowded areas such as beam–column intersections. The\\nspeciﬁcation covers plain and deformed bars cut to lengths and having heads either forged or\\nwelded to one or both ends. Alternatively, heads may be connected to the bars by internal\\nthreads in the head mating to threads on the bar end or by a separate threaded nut to secure the\\nhead to the bar. Heads are forge formed, machined from bar stock, or cut from plate. Figure 1.3\\nillustrates a headed bar detail. The International Code Council has published acceptance criteria\\nfor headed ends of concrete reinforcement (ACC 347).\\ndb\\nFIGURE 1 . 3 Headed deformed\\nreinforcing bar.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 43}, page_content='McCormac c01.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 2:57 P.M. Page 24\\n24 CHAPTER 1 Introduction\\n1.17 Grades of Reinforcing Steel\\nReinforcing bars may be rolled from billet steel, axle steel, or rail steel. Only o ccasionally,\\nhowever, are they rolled from old train rails or locomotive axles. These latter steels have been\\ncold-worked for many years and are not as ductile as the billet steels.\\nThere are several types of reinforcing bars, designated by the ASTM, which are listed\\nafter this paragraph. These steels are available in different grades as Grade 50, Grade 60, and\\nso on, where Grade 50 means the steel has a speciﬁed yield point of 50,000 psi, Grade 60\\nmeans 60,000 psi, and so on.\\n• ASTM A615: Deformed and plain billet steel bars. These bars, which must be marked\\nwith the letter S (for type of steel), are the most widely used reinforcing bars in the\\nUnited States. Bars are of four minimum yield strength levels: 40,000 psi (280 MPa);\\n60,000 psi (420 MPa); 75,000 psi (520 MPa); and 80,000 psi (550 MPa).\\n• ASTM A706: Low-alloy deformed and plain bars. These bars, which must be marked\\nwith the letter W (for type of steel), are to be used where controlled tensile properties\\nand/or specially controlled chemical composition is required for welding purposes. They\\nare available in two grades: 60,000 psi (420 MPa) and 80,000 psi (550 MPa), designated\\nas Grade 60 (420) and Grade 80 (550), respectively.\\n• ASTM A996: Deformed rail steel or axle steel bars. They must be marked with the letter\\nR (for type of steel).\\n• When deformed bars are produced to meet both the A615 and A706 speciﬁcations, they\\nmust be marked with both the letters S and W.\\nDesigners in almost all parts of the United States will probably never encounter rail or\\naxle steel bars (A996) b ecause they are available in such limited areas of the c ountry. Of the\\n23 U.S. manufacturers of reinforcing bars listed by the Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute, 21\\nonly ﬁve manufacture rail steel bars and not one manufactures axle bars.\\nAlmost all reinforcing bars conform to the A615 speciﬁcation, and a large proportion of\\nthe material used to make them is not new steel but is melted reclaimed steel, such as that from\\nold car bodies. Bars conforming to the A706 speciﬁcation are intended for certain uses when\\nwelding and/or bending are of particular importance. Bars conforming to this speciﬁcation may\\nnot always be available from local suppliers.\\nThere is only a small difference between the prices of reinforcing steel with yield strengths\\nof 40 ksi and 60 ksi. As a result, the 60-ksi bars are the most commonly used in reinforced\\nconcrete design.\\nWhen bars are made from steels with fy of 60 ksi or more, the ACI (Section 3.5.3.2)\\nstates that the speciﬁed yield strength must be the stress corresponding to a strain of 0.35%.\\nFor bars withfy less than 60 ksi, the yield strength shall be taken as the stress corresponding\\nto a strain of 0.5%. The ACI (Section 9.4) has established an upper limit of 80 ksi on yield\\nstrengths permitted for design calculations for reinforced concrete. If the ACI were to permit\\nthe use of steels with yield strengths greater than 80 ksi, it would have to provide other design\\nrestrictions, since the yield strain of 80 ksi steel is almost equal to the ultimate concrete strain\\nin compression. (This last sentence will make sense after the reader has studied Chapter 2.)\\nThere has been gradually increasing demand through the years for Grade 75 and Grade\\n80 steel, particularly for use in high-rise buildings, where it is used in combination with high-\\nstrength concretes. The results are smaller columns, more rentable ﬂoor space, and smaller\\nfoundations for the resulting lighter buildings.\\n21 Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute, 2001, Manual of Standard Practice , 27th ed., Chicago.

Page 25\\n1.18 SI Bar Sizes and Material Strengths 25\\nGrade 75 and Grade 80 steel are appreciably higher in cost, and the #14 and #18 bars\\nare often unavailable from stock and will probably have to be specially ordered from the steel\\nmills. This means that there may have to be a special rolling to supply the steel. As a result,\\nits use may not be economically justiﬁed unless at least 50 or 60 tons are ordered.\\nYield stresses above 60 ksi are also available in welded wire fabric, but the speciﬁed\\nstresses must correspond to strains of 0.35%. Smooth fabric must conform to ASTM A185,\\nwhereas deformed fabric cannot be smaller than size D4 and must conform to ASTM A496.\\nThe modulus of elasticity for nonprestressed steels is considered to be equal to 29 × 106\\npsi. For prestressed steels, it varies somewhat from manufacturer to manufacturer, with a value\\nof 27 × 106 psi being fairly common.\\nStainless steel reinforcing (ASTM A955) was introduced in the 2008 code. It is highly\\nresistant to corrosion, especially pitting and crevice corrosion from exposure to chloride-\\ncontaining solutions such as deicing salts. While it is more expensive than normal carbon\\nsteel reinforcement, its life-cycle cost may be less when the costs of maintenance and repairs\\nare considered.\\n1.18 SI Bar Sizes and Material Strengths\\nThe metric version of the ACI Code 318M-11 makes use of the same reinforcing bars used\\nfor designs using U.S. customary units. The metric bar dimensions are merely soft conver-\\nsions (i.e., almost equivalent) of the customary sizes. The SI concrete strengths (f ′\\nc ) and\\nthe minimum steel yield strengths (fy) are converted from the customary values into metric\\nunits and rounded off a bit. A brief summary of metric bar sizes and material strengths\\nis presented in the following paragraphs. These values are used for the SI examples and\\nhomework problems throughout the text.\\n1. The bar sizes used in the metric version of the code correspond to U.S. sizes\\n#3 through #18 bars. They are numbered 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 29, 32, 36, 43,\\nand 57. These numbers represent the U.S. customary bar diameters rounded to\\nthe nearest millimeter (mm). For instance, the metric #10 bar has a diameter\\nequal to 9.5 mm, the metric #13 bar has a diameter equal to 12.7 mm, and\\nso on. Detailed information concerning metric reinforcing bar diameters, cross-\\nsectional areas, masses, and ASTM classiﬁcations is provided in Appendix B,\\nTables B.2 and B.3.\\n2. The steel reinforcing grades, or minimum steel yield strengths, referred to in\\nthe code are 300, 350, 420, and 520 MPa. These correspond, respectively, to\\n43,511, 50,763, 60,916, and 75,420 psi and, thus, correspond approximately to\\nGrade 40, 50, 60, and 75 bars. Appendix B, Table B.3 provides ASTM numbers,\\nsteel grades, and bar sizes available in each grade.\\n3. The concrete strengths in metric units referred to in the code are 17, 21, 24, 28, 35,\\nand 42 MPa. These correspond respectively to 2466, 3046, 3481, 4061, 5076, and\\n6092 psi, that is, to 2500-, 3000-, 3500-, 4000-, 5000-, and 6000-psi concretes.\\nIn 1997, the producers of steel reinforcing bars in the United States began to produce\\nsoft metric bars. These are the same bars we have long called standard inch-pound bars, but\\nthey are marked with metric units. Today, the large proportion of metric bars manufactured in\\nthe United States are soft metric. By producing the exact same bars, the industry does not have\\nto keep two different inventories (one set of inch-pound bar sizes and another set of different\\nbar sizes in metric units). Table 1.1 shows the bar sizes given in both sets of units.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 45}, page_content='McCormac c01.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 2:57 P.M.

The structures usually\\ninvolved are bridge decks, parking garages, wastewater treatment plants, and various coastal\\nstructures. We must also consider structures subjected to occasional chemical spills that involve\\nchlorides.\\nShould the reinforcement be insufﬁciently protected, it will corrode; as it corrodes, the\\nresulting oxides occupy a volume far greater than that of the original metal. The results are\\nlarge outward pressures that can lead to severe cracking and spalling of the concrete. This\\nreduces the concrete protection, or cover, for the steel, and corrosion accelerates. Also, the\\nbond, or sticking of the concrete to the steel, is reduced. The result of all of these factors is a\\ndecided reduction in the life of the structure.\\nSection 7.7.6 of the code requires that for corrosive environments, more concrete cover\\nmust be provided for the reinforcing; it also requires that special concrete proportions or mixes\\nbe used.\\nThe lives of such structures can be greatly increased if epoxy-coated reinforcing bars are\\nused. Such bars need to be handled very carefully so as not to break off any of the coating.\\nFurthermore, they do not bond as well to the concrete, and their embedment lengths will have\\nto be increased somewhat for that reason, as you will learn in Chapter 7. A new type of bar\\ncoating, a dual coating of a zinc alloy and an epoxy coating, was introduced in the 2011 ACI\\n318 Code: ASTM A1055. Use of stainless steel reinforcing, as described in Section 1.14, can\\nalso signiﬁcantly increase the service life of structures exposed to corrosive environments.\\n1.20 Identifying Marks on Reinforcing Bars\\nIt is essential for people in the shop and the ﬁeld to be able to identify at a glance the sizes\\nand grades of reinforcing bars. If they are not able to do this, smaller and lower-grade bars\\nother than those intended by the designer may be used. To prevent such mistakes, deformed\\nbars have rolled-in identiﬁcation markings on their surfaces. These markings are described in\\nthe following list and are illustrated in Figure 1.4.\\n1.

No loads\\nthat may reasonably be expected to occur may be overlooked. After loads are estimated,\\nthe next problem is to decide the worst possible combinations of these loads that might\\noccur at one time. For instance, would a highway bridge completely covered with ice and\\nsnow be simultaneously subjected to fast-moving lines of heavily loaded trailer trucks in\\nevery lane and to a 90-mile lateral wind, or is some lesser combination of these loads more\\nreasonable?\\nThe next few sections of this chapter provide a brief introduction to the types of loads\\nwith which the structural designer must be familiar. The purpose of these sections is not to\\ndiscuss loads in great detail but rather to give the reader a feel for the subject. As will be seen,\\nloads are classed as being dead, live, or environmental.\\n1.22 Dead Loads\\nDead loads are loads of constant magnitude that remain in one position. They include the weight\\nof the structure under consideration as well as any ﬁxtures that are permanently attached to\\nit. For a reinforced concrete building, some dead loads are the frames, walls, ﬂoors, ceilings,\\nstairways, roofs, and plumbing.\\nTo design a structure, it is necessary for the weights or dead loads of the various parts\\nto be estimated for use in the analysis. The exact sizes and weights of the parts are not known\\nuntil the structural analysis is made and the members of the structure are selected. The weights,\\nas determined from the actual design, must be compared with the estimated weights. If large\\ndiscrepancies are present, it will be necessary to repeat the analysis and design using better\\nestimated weights.\\nReasonable estimates of structure weights may be obtained by referring to similar struc-\\ntures or to various formulas and tables available in most civil engineering handbooks. An\\nexperienced designer can estimate very closely the weights of most structures and will spend\\nlittle time repeating designs b ecause of poor estimates.\\nThe approximate weights of some common materials used for ﬂoors, walls, roofs, and\\nthe like are given in Table 1.2.\\nTABLE 1. 2 Weights of Some Common Building Materials\\nReinforced concrete (12 in.) 150 psf 2 × 12 @ 16-in. double wood ﬂoor 7 psf\\nAcoustical ceiling tile 1 psf Linoleum or asphalt tile 1 psf\\nSuspended ceiling 2 psf Hardwood ﬂooring ( 7\\n8 in.) 4 psf\\nPlaster on concrete 5 psf 1-in. cement on stone-concrete ﬁll 32 psf\\nAsphalt shingles 2 psf Movable steel partitions 4 psf\\n3-ply ready rooﬁng 1 psf Wood studs with 1\\n2 -in. gypsum 8 psf\\nMechanical duct allowance 4 psf Clay brick wythes (4 in.) 39 psf\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 48}, page_content='McCormac c01.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 2:57 P.M. Page 29\\n1.23 Live Loads 29\\n1.23 Live Loads\\nLive loads are loads that can change in magnitude and position. They include occupancy loads,\\nwarehouse materials, construction loads, overhead service cranes, equipment operating loads,\\nand many others. In general, they are induced by gravity.\\nSome typical ﬂoor live loads that act on building structures are presented in Table 1.3.\\nThese loads, which are taken from Table 4-1 in ASCE 7-10,22 act downward and are distributed\\nuniformly over an entire ﬂoor. By contrast, roof live loads are 20 psf (pounds per square feet)\\nmaximum distributed uniformly over the entire roof.\\nAmong the many other types of live loads are:\\nTrafﬁc loads for bridges—Bridges are subjected to series of concentrated loads of varying\\nmagnitude caused by groups of truck or train wheels.\\nImpact loads —Impact loads are caused by the vibration of moving or movable loads.\\nIt is obvious that a crate dropped on the ﬂoor of a warehouse or a truck bouncing\\non uneven pavement of a bridge causes greater forces than would occur if the loads\\nwere applied gently and gradually. Impact loads are equal to the difference between\\nthe magnitude of the loads actually caused and the magnitude of the loads had they\\nbeen dead loads.\\nLongitudinal loads —Longitudinal loads also need to be considered in designing some\\nstructures. Stopping a train on a railroad bridge or a truck on a highway bridge causes\\nlongitudinal forces to be applied. It is not difﬁcult to imagine the tremendous longi-\\ntudinal force developed when the driver of a 40-ton trailer truck traveling at 60 mph\\nsuddenly has to apply the brakes while crossing a highway bridge. There are other\\nlongitudinal load situations, such as ships running into docks and the movement of\\ntraveling cranes that are supported by building frames.\\nMiscellaneous loads —Among the other types of live loads with which the structural\\ndesigner will have to contend are soil pressures (such as the exertion of lateral earth\\npressures on walls or upward pressures on foundations), hydrostatic pressures (such as\\nwater pressure on dams, inertia forces of large bodies of water during earthquakes, and\\nuplift pressures on tanks and basement structures),blast loads (caused by explosions,\\nsonic booms, and military weapons), and centrifugal forces (such as those caused on\\ncurved bridges by trucks and trains or similar effects on roller coasters).\\nTABLE 1. 3 Some Typical Uniformly Distributed Live Loads\\nLobbies of assembly areas 100 psf Classrooms in schools 40 psf\\nDance hall and ballrooms 100 psf Upper-ﬂoor corridors in schools 80 psf\\nLibrary reading rooms 60 psf Stairs and exitways 100 psf\\nLibrary stack rooms 150 psf Heavy storage warehouse 250 psf\\nLight manufacturing 125 psf Retail stores—ﬁrst ﬂoor 100 psf\\nOfﬁces in ofﬁce buildings 50 psf Retail stores—upper ﬂoors 75 psf\\nResidential dwelling areas 40 psf Walkways and elevated platforms 60 psf\\npsf = pounds per square foot\\n22 American Society of Civil Engineers, 2010, Minimum Design Loads for Buildingsand Other Structures , ASCE 7-10 (Reston,\\nV A: American Society of Civil Engineers), pp. 17–19.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 49}, page_content='McCormac c01.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 2:57 P.M.

This reduction can signiﬁcantly reduce the total design live load on\\na structure, resulting in much lower column loads at lower ﬂoors and footing loads.\\n1.24 Environmental Loads\\nEnvironmental loads are loads caused by the environment in which the structure is located. For\\nbuildings, they are caused by rain, snow, wind, temperature change, and earthquake. Strictly\\nspeaking, these are also live loads, but they are the result of the environment in which the\\nstructure is located. Although they do vary with time, they are not all caused by gravity or\\noperating conditions, as is typical with other live loads. In the next few paragraphs, a few\\ncomments are made about the various kinds of environmental loads.\\n1. Snow and ice. In the colder states, snow and ice loads are often quite important. One\\ninch of snow is equivalent to approximately 0.5 psf, but it may be higher at lower elevations\\nwhere snow is denser. For roof designs, snow loads of from 10 psf to 40 psf are used, the\\nmagnitude depending primarily on the slope of the roof and to a lesser degree on the character\\nof the roof surface. The larger values are used for ﬂat roofs, the smaller ones for sloped roofs.\\nSnow tends to slide off sloped roofs, particularly those with metal or slate surfaces. A load of\\napproximately 10 psf might be used for 45◦ slopes, and a 40-psf load might be used for ﬂat'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 50}, page_content='McCormac c01.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 2:57 P.M. Page 31\\n1.24 Environmental Loads 31\\nroofs. Studies of snowfall records in areas with severe winters may indicate the occurrence of\\nsnow loads much greater than 40 psf, with values as high as 80 psf in northern Maine.\\nSnow is a variable load, which may cover an entire roof or only part of it. There may be\\ndrifts against walls or buildup in valleys or between parapets. Snow may slide off one roof and\\nonto a lower one. The wind may blow it off one side of a sloping roof, or the snow may crust\\nover and remain in position even during very heavy winds. The snow loads that are applied to\\na structure are dependent upon many factors, including geographic location, the pitch of the\\nroof, sheltering, and the shape of the roof.\\n2. Rain. Although snow loads are a more severe problem than rain loads for the usual\\nroof, the situation may be reversed for ﬂat roofs—particularly those in warmer climates. If\\nwater on a ﬂat roof accumulates faster than it runs off, the result is calledponding because\\nthe increased load causes the roof to deﬂect into a dish shape that can hold more water, which\\ncauses greater deﬂections, and so on. This process continues until equilibrium is reached or\\nuntil collapse occurs. Ponding is a serious matter, as illustrated by the large number of ﬂat-roof\\nfailures that occur as a result of ponding every year in the United States. It has been claimed that\\nalmost 50% of the lawsuits faced by building designers are concerned with rooﬁng systems.23\\nPonding is one of the common subjects of such litigation.\\n3. Wind. A survey of engineering literature for the past 150 years reveals many references\\nto structural failures caused by wind. Perhaps the most infamous of these have been bridge\\nfailures such as those of the Tay Bridge in Scotland in 1879 (which caused the deaths of 75\\npersons) and the Tacoma Narrows Bridge (Tacoma, Washington) in 1940. There have also\\nbeen some disastrous building failures from wind during the same period, such as that of the\\nUnion Carbide Building in Toronto in 1958. It is important to realize that a large percentage\\nof building failures from wind have occurred during the buildings’ erection.24\\nA great deal of research has been conducted in r ecent years on the subject of wind\\nloads. Nevertheless, more study is needed because the estimation of wind forces can by no\\nmeans be classiﬁed as an exact science. The magnitude and duration of wind loads vary with\\ngeographical locations, the heights of structures aboveground, the types of terrain around the\\nstructures, the proximity of other buildings, the location within the structure, and the character\\nof the wind itself.\\nChapters 26 to 31 of the ASCE 7-10 speciﬁcation provide a rather lengthy procedure\\nfor estimating the wind pressures applied to buildings. The procedure involves several factors\\nwith which we attempt to account for the terrain around the building, the importance of the\\nbuilding regarding human life and welfare, and of course the wind speed at the building site.\\nAlthough use of the equations is rather complex, the work can be greatly simpliﬁed with the\\ntables presented in the speciﬁcation. The reader is cautioned, however, that the tables presented\\nare for buildings of regular shapes. If a building having an irregular or unusual geometry is\\nbeing considered, wind tunnel studies may be necessary.\\nThe basic form of the equation presented in the speciﬁcation is\\np = qCG\\nIn this equation, p is the estimated wind load (in psf) acting on the structure. This wind\\nload will vary with height above the ground and with the location on the structure. The\\nquantity,q, is the reference velocity pressure. It varies with height and with exposure to\\n23 V an Ryzin, Gary, 1980, “Roof Design: Avoid Ponding by Sloping to Drain,” Civil Engineering (January), pp. 77–81.\\n24 Task Committee on Wind Forces, Committee on Loads and Stresses, Structural Division, ASCE, 1961, “Wind Forces on\\nStructures,” Final Report, Transactions ASCE 126, Part II, pp. 1124–1125.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 51}, page_content='McCormac c01.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 2:57 P.M. Page 32\\n32 CHAPTER 1 Introduction\\nthe wind. The aerodynamic shape factor, C, is dependent upon the shape and orientation\\nof the building with respect to the direction from which the wind is blowing. Lastly,\\nthe gust response factor,G, is dependent upon the nature of the wind and the location\\nof the building. Other considerations in determining design wind pressure include importance\\nfactor and surface roughness.\\n4. Seismic loads. Many areas of the world are in earthquake territory, and in those\\nareas, it is necessary to consider seismic forces in design for all types of structures. Through\\nthe centuries, there have been catastrophic failures of buildings, bridges, and other structures\\nduring earthquakes. It has been estimated that as many as 50,000 people lost their lives in\\nthe 1988 earthquake in Armenia.25 The 1989 Loma Prieta and 1994 Northridge earthquakes\\nin California caused many billions of dollars of property damage as well as considerable loss\\nof life. The 2008 earthquake in Sichuan Province, China, caused 69,000 fatalities and another\\n18,000 missing.\\nRecent earthquakes have clearly shown that the average building or bridge that has not\\nbeen designed for earthquake forces can be destroyed by an earthquake that is not particularly\\nsevere. Most structures can be economically designed and constructed to withstand the forces\\ncaused during most earthquakes. The cost of providing seismic resistance to existing structures\\n(calledretroﬁtting), however, can be extremely high.\\nSome engineers seem to think that the seismic loads to be used in design are merely\\npercentage increases of the wind loads. This assumption is incorrect, however, as seismic loads\\nare different in their action and are not proportional to the exposed area of the building but\\nrather are proportional to the distribution of the mass of the building above the particular level\\nbeing considered.\\nAnother factor to be considered in seismic design is the soil condition. Almost all of the\\nstructural damage and loss of life in the Loma Prieta earthquake occurred in areas that have\\nsoft clay soils. Apparently these soils ampliﬁed the motions of the underlying rock.26\\nIt is well to understand that earthquakes load structures in an indirect fashion. The ground\\nis displaced, and because the structures are connected to the ground, they are also displaced and\\nvibrated. As a result, various deformations and stresses are caused throughout the structures.\\nFrom the preceding information, you can understand that no external forces are applied\\naboveground by earthquakes to structures. Procedures for estimating seismic forces such as\\nthe ones presented in Chapters 11 to 23 of ASCE 7-10 are very complicated. As a result, they\\nusually are addressed in advanced structural analysis courses, such as structural dynamics or\\nearthquake resistance design courses.\\n1.25 Selection of Design Loads\\nTo assist the designer in estimating the magnitudes of live loads with which he or she should\\nproportion structures, various records have been assembled through the years in the form of\\nbuilding codes and speciﬁcations. These publications provide conservative estimates of live-\\nload magnitudes for various situations. One of the most widely used design-load speciﬁcations\\nfor buildings is that published by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).27\\n25 Fairweather, V., 1990, “The Next Earthquake,” Civil Engineering (March), pp. 54–57.\\n26 Ibid.\\n27 American Society of Civil Engineers, 2010, Minimum Design Loads for Buildingsand Other Structures , ASCE 7-10 (Reston,\\nV A: American Society of Civil Engineers), 608 pages.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 52}, page_content='McCormac c01.tex V2 - January 10, 2013 9:10 P.M.

Unfortunately, the values given in these various\\ncodes vary from city to city, and the designer must be sure to meet the requirements of a\\nparticular locality. In the absence of a governing code, the ASCE Code is an excellent one to\\nfollow.\\nSome other commonly used speciﬁcations are:\\n• For railroad bridges, American Railway Engineering Association (AREA). 28\\n• For highway bridges, American Association o f State Highway and Transportation Ofﬁcials\\n(AASHTO).29\\n• For buildings, the International Building Code (IBC). 30\\nThese speciﬁcations will on many occasions clearly prescribe the loads for which struc-\\ntures are to be designed.

Over the past several d ecades, insufﬁcient estimates of\\nfuture trafﬁc loads by bridge designers have resulted in a great number of replacements with\\nwider and stronger structures.\\n1.26 Calculation Accuracy\\nA most important point, which many students w ith their amazing computers and pocket cal-\\nculators have difﬁculty in understanding, is that reinforced concrete design is not an exact\\nscience for which answers can be conﬁdently calculated to six or eight places.

Calculations to more than two or three signiﬁcant ﬁgures are obviously of little\\nvalue and may actually mislead students into a false sense of accuracy.\\n1.27 Impact of Computers on Reinforced Concrete Design\\nThe availability of personal computers has drastically changed the way in which reinforced\\nconcrete structures are analyzed and designed. In nearly every engineering school and ofﬁce,\\ncomputers are routinely used to handle structural design problems.\\nMany calculations are involved in reinforced concrete design, and many of these calcu-\\nlations are quite time consuming. With a computer, the designer can reduce the time required\\nfor these calculations tremendously and, thus, supposedly have time to consider alternative\\ndesigns.\\nAlthough computers do increase design productivity, they do undoubtedly tend at the\\nsame time to reduce the designer’s “feel” for structures. This can be a special problem for\\nyoung engineers with little previous design experience. Unless designers have this “feel,”\\ncomputer usage, though expediting the work and reducing many errors, may occasionally\\nresult in large mistakes.\\nIt is interesting to note that up to the present time, the feeling at most engineering schools\\nhas been that the best way to teach reinforced concrete design is with chalk and blackboard,\\nsupplemented with some computer examples.\\nAccompanying this text are several Excel spreadsheets that can be downloaded from this\\nbook’s website at: www.wiley.com/college/mccormac.\\nThese spreadsheets are intended to allow the student to consider multiple alternative\\ndesigns and not as a tool to work basic homework problems.\\nPROBLEMS\\nProblem 1.1 Name several of the admixtures that are used in\\nconcrete mixes.

Page 35\\nCHAPTER 2\\nFlexural Analysis of Beams\\n2.1 Introduction\\nIn this section, it is assumed that a small transverse load is placed on a concrete beam with\\ntensile reinforcing and that the load is gradually increased in magnitude until the beam fails. As\\nthis takes place, the beam will go through three distinct stages before collapse occurs. These\\nare: (1) the uncracked concrete stage, (2) the concrete cracked–elastic stresses stage, and (3)\\nthe ultimate-strength stage. A relatively long beam is considered for this discussion so that\\nshear will not have a large effect on its behavior.\\nUncracked Concrete Stage\\nAt small loads when the tensile stresses are less than the modulus of rupture (the bending\\ntensile stress at which the concrete begins to crack), the entire cross section of the beam resists\\nbending, with compression on one side and tension on the other. Figure 2.1 shows the variation\\nof stresses and strains for these small loads; a numerical example of this type is presented in\\nSection 2.2.\\nConcrete Cracked–Elastic Stresses Stage\\nAs the load is increased after the modulus of rupture of the concrete is ex ceeded, cracks begin\\nto develop in the bottom of the beam. The moment at which these cracks begin to form—that\\nis, when the tensile stress in the bottom of the beam equals the modulus of rupture—is referred\\nto as the cracking moment, Mcr. As the load is further increased, these cracks quickly spread up\\nto the vicinity of the neutral axis, and then the neutral axis begins to move upward. The cracks\\noccur at those places along the beam where the actual moment is greater than the cracking\\nmoment, as shown in Figure 2.2(a).\\nNow that the bottom has cracked, another stage is present because the concrete in the\\ncracked zone obviously cannot resist tensile stresses—the steel must do it. This stage will\\n²c in compression\\n²s for steel in tension\\n²c in tension\\nstrains stresses\\nfc in compression\\nft tension in concrete\\n(This term is defined\\n in Section 2.3.)\\nfs\\nn\\nFIGURE 2 . 1 Uncracked concrete stage.\\n35'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 55}, page_content='McCormac c02.tex V2 - January 10, 2013 6:34 P.M.

In this stage, the compressive\\nstresses vary linearly with the distance from the neutral axis or as a straight line.\\nThe straight-line stress–strain variation normally occurs in reinforced concrete beams\\nunder normal service-load conditions b ecause at those loads, the stresses are generally less\\nthan 0.50 f ′\\nc . To compute the concrete and steel stresses in this range, the transformed-area\\nmethod (to be presented in Section 2.3) is used. The service or working loads are the loads that\\nare assumed to actually occur when a structure is in use or service. Under these loads, moments\\ndevelop that are considerably larger than the cracking moments. Obviously, the tensile side\\nof the beam will be cracked. You will learn to estimate crack widths and methods of limiting\\ntheir widths in Chapter 6.\\nBeam Failure—Ultimate-Strength Stage\\nAs the load is increased further so that the compressive stresses are greater than 0.50 f ′\\nc ,t h e\\ntensile cracks move farther upward, as does the neutral axis, and the concrete compression\\nstresses begin to change appreciably from a straight line. For this initial discussion, it is\\nassumed that the reinforcing bars have yielded. The stress variation is much like that shown in\\nFigure 2.3. You should relate the information shown in this ﬁgure to that given in Figure 1.1\\nin Chapter 1 as to the changing ratio of stress to strain at different stress levels.\\nTo further illustrate the three stages of beam behavior that have just been described, a\\nmoment–curvature diagram is shown in Figure 2.4. 1 For this diagram, θ is deﬁned as the angle\\n1 MacGregor, J.

The diagram\\nwill follow almost a straight line from Mcr to the point where the reinforcing is stressed to\\nits yield point. Until the steel yields, a fairly large additional load is required to appreciably\\nincrease the beam’s deﬂection.\\nAfter the steel yields, the beam has very little additional moment capacity, and only a\\nsmall additional load is required to substantially increase rotations as well as deﬂections. The\\nslope of the diagram is now very ﬂat.\\n2.2 Cracking Moment\\nThe area of reinforcing as a percentage of the total cross-sectional area of a beam is quite\\nsmall (usually 2% or less), and its effect on the beam properties is almost negligible as long\\nas the beam is uncracked. Therefore, an approximate calculation of the bending stresses in\\nsuch a beam can be obtained based on the gross properties of the beam’s cross section. The\\nstress in the concrete at any point a distancey from the neutral axis of the cross section can\\nbe determined from the following ﬂexure formula in which M is the bending moment equal to\\nor less than the cracking moment of the section and Ig is the gross moment of inertia of the\\ncross section:\\nf = My\\nIg\\nSection 9.5.2.3 of the ACI Code states that the cracking moment of a section may be\\ndetermined with ACI Equation 9-9, in which fr is the modulus of rupture of the concrete and\\nyt is the distance from the centroidal axis of the section to its extreme ﬁber in tension.

Don’t\\nget the impression that this is the best orientation for a T beam, however. In the next section,\\nwhen we examine reinforced sections, the opposite will be true.\\n2.3 Elastic Stresses—Concrete Cracked\\nWhen the bending moment is sufﬁciently large to cause the tensile stress in the extreme ﬁbers\\nto be greater than the modulus of rupture, it is assumed that all of the concrete on the tensile\\nside of the beam is cracked and must be neglected in the ﬂexure calculations.\\nThe cracking moment of a beam is normally quite small compared to the service load\\nmoment. Thus, when the service loads are applied, the bottom of the beam cracks. The cracking\\nof the beam does not necessarily mean that the beam is going to fail. The reinforcing bars on\\nthe tensile side begin to pick up the tension caused by the applied moment.\\nOn the tensile side of the beam, an assumption of perfect bond is made between the\\nreinforcing bars and the concrete. Thus, the strain in the concrete and in the steel will be equal\\nat equal distances from the neutral axis. If the strains in the two materials at a particular point\\nare the same, however, their stresses cannot be the same since they have different moduli of\\nelasticity. Thus, their stresses are in proportion to the ratio of their moduli of elasticity. The\\nratio of the steel modulus to the concrete modulus is called the modular ratio, n:\\nn = Es\\nEc\\nIf the modular ratio for a particular beam is 10, the stress in the steel will be 10 times\\nthe stress in the concrete at the same distance from the neutral axis. Another way of say-\\ning this is that whenn = 10, 1 in. 2 of steel will carry the same total force as 10 in. 2 of\\nconcrete.\\nFor the beam of Figure 2.6, the steel bars are replaced with an equivalent area of ﬁctitious\\nconcrete (nAs), which supposedly can resist tension. This area is referred to as the transformed\\narea. The resulting revised cross section or transformed section is handled by the usual methods\\nfor elastic homogeneous beams. Also shown in the ﬁgure is a diagram showing the stress\\nvariation in the beam.

The ﬁrst moment of the\\ncompression area of the beam cross section about the neutral axis must equal the ﬁrst moment\\nof the tensile area about the neutral axis.

They used to be 24,000 lb/in.2 for Grade 60 reinforcing steel. This is about a\\n1.5% overstress in the steel, and many engineers would accept this much overstress as being\\nwithin the accuracy of their other assumptions. This beam would be called ‘‘tension controlled’’\\nbecause the moment capacity is controlled by the steel, not the concrete. This same beam\\ncould be compression controlled if a lot more steel were used. Tension-controlled beams are\\npreferable to compression-controlled ones, as will be discussed later in this text.\\nExample 2.7 illustrates the analysis of a doubly reinforced concrete beam—that is, one\\nthat has compression steel as well as tensile steel. Compression steel is generally thought to\\nbe uneconomical, but o ccasionally its use is quite advantageous.\\nCompression steel will permit the use of appreciably smaller beams than those that make\\nuse of tensile steel only. Reduced sizes can be very important where space or architectural\\nrequirements limit the sizes of beams. Compression steel is quite helpful in reducing long-term\\ndeﬂections, and such steel is useful for positioning stirrups or shear reinforcing, a subject to\\nbe discussed in Chapter 8. A detailed discussion of doubly reinforced beams is presented in\\nChapter 5.\\nThe creep or plastic ﬂow of concrete was described in Section 1.11. Should the com-\\npression side of a beam be reinforced, the long-term stresses in that reinforcing will be greatly\\naffected by the creep in the concrete. As time goes by, the compression concrete will compact\\nmore tightly, leaving the reinforcing bars (which themselves have negligible creep) to carry\\nmore and more of the load.\\nAs a consequence of this creep in the concrete, the stresses in the compression bars\\ncomputed by the transformed-area method are assumed to double as time goes by. In\\nExample 2.7, the transformed area of the compression bars is assumed to equal 2n times their\\narea, A′\\ns .\\nOn the subject of “hairsplitting,” it will be noted in the example that the compression\\nsteel area is really multiplied by 2 n − 1. The transformed area of the compression side equals\\nthe gross compression area of the concrete plus 2nA′\\ns minus the area of the holes in the concrete\\n(1A′\\ns ), which theoretically should not have been included in the concrete part. This equals the\\ncompression concrete area plus (2n − 1)A′\\ns . Similarly, 2n − 1i su s e di nt h em o m e n to fi n e r t i a\\ncalculations.

This topic is continued at considerable length in the next chapter,\\nwhere formulas, limitations, designs, and other matters are presented. For this discussion, it is\\nassumed that the tensile reinforcing bars are stressed to their yield point before the concrete on\\nthe compressive side of the beam is crushed. You will learn in Chapter 3 that the ACI Code\\nrequires all beam designs to fall into this category.\\nAfter the concrete compression stresses exceed a bout 0.50f ′\\nc , they no longer vary directly\\nas the distance from the neutral axis or as a straight line. Rather, they vary much as shown\\nin Figure 2.11(b). It is assumed for the purpose of this discussion that the curved com-\\npression diagram is replaced with a rectangular one with a constant stress of 0.85 f ′\\nc ,a s\\nshown in part (c) of the ﬁgure. The rectangular diagram of depth a is assumed to have\\nthe same c.g. (center of gravity) and total magnitude as the curved diagram. (In Section\\n3.4 of Chapter 3 of this text, you will learn that this distancea is set equal to β1c,w h e r e\\nβ1 is a value determined by testing and speciﬁed by the code.) These assumptions will\\nenable us to easily calculate the theoretical or nominal ﬂexural strength of reinforced concrete\\nbeams. Experimental tests show that with the assumptions used here, accurate ﬂexural strengths\\nare determined.\\nTo obtain the nominal or theoretical moment strength of a beam, the simple steps to\\nfollow are illustrated in Figure 2.11 and Example 2.8.\\n1. Compute total tensile force T = As fy.\\n2. Equate total compression force C = 0.85f ′\\nc ab to As fy and solve for a. In this expression,\\nab is the assumed area stressed in compression at 0.85 f ′\\nc . The compression force C and\\nthe tensile force T must be equal to maintain equilibrium at the section.\\n3.

Page 65\\nCHAPTER 3\\nStrength Analysis of Beams\\nAccording to ACI Code\\n3.1 Design Methods\\nFrom the early 1900s until the early 1960s, nearly all reinforced concrete design in the United\\nStates was performed by the working-stress design method (also called allowable-stress design\\nor straight-line design). In this method, frequently referred to as WSD, the dead and live loads\\nto be supported, called working loads or service loads, were ﬁrst estimated. Then the members\\nof the structure were proportioned so that stresses calculated by a transformed area did not\\nexceed certain permissible or allowable values.\\nAfter 1963, the ultimate-strength design method rapidly gained popularity b ecause (1) it\\nmakes use of a more rational approach than does WSD, (2) it uses a more realistic consideration\\nof safety, and (3) it provides more economical designs. With this method (now called strength\\ndesign), the working dead and live loads are multiplied by certain load factors (equivalent\\nto safety factors), and the resulting values are called factored loads . The members are then\\nselected so they will theoretically just fail under the factored loads.\\nEven though almost all of the reinforced concrete structures the reader will encounter\\nwill be designed by the strength design method, it is still useful to be familiar with WSD for\\nseveral reasons:\\n1. Some designers use WSD for proportioning ﬂuid-containing structures (such as water\\ntanks and various sanitary structures). When these structures are designed by WSD,\\nstresses are kept at fairly low levels, with the result that there is appreciably less cracking\\nand less consequent leakage. (If the designer uses strength design and makes use of\\nproper crack control methods, as described in Chapter 6, there should be few leakage\\nproblems.)\\n2. The ACI method for calculating the moments of inertia to be used for deﬂection calcu-\\nlations requires some knowledge of the working-stress procedure.\\n3. The design of prestressed concrete members is based not only on the strength method\\nbut also on elastic stress calculations at service load conditions.\\nThe reader should realize that working-stress design has several disadvantages. When\\nusing the method, the designer has little knowledge about the magnitudes of safety factors\\nagainst collapse; no consideration is given to the fact that different safety factors are desirable\\nfor dead and live loads; the method does not account for variations in resistances and loads,\\nnor does it account for the possibility that as loads are increased, some increase at different\\nrates than others.\\nIn 1956, the ACI Code for the ﬁrst time included ultimate-strength design, as an appendix,\\nalthough the concrete codes of several other countries had been based on such considera-\\ntions for several decades. In 1963, the code gave ultimate-strength design equal status with\\nworking-stress design; the 1971 code made the method the predominant method and only brieﬂy\\nmentioned the working-stress method.

Page 66\\n66 CHAPTER 3 Strength Analysis of Beams According to ACI Code\\nToday’s design method was called ultimate-strength design for several decades, but, as\\nmentioned, the code now uses the term strength design. The strength for a particular reinforced\\nconcrete member is a value given by the code and is not necessarily the true ultimate strength of\\nthe member. Therefore, the more general termstrength design is used whether beam strength,\\ncolumn strength, shear strength, or others are being considered.\\n3.2 Advantages of Strength Design\\nAmong the several advantages of the strength design method as compared to the no-longer-\\npermitted working-stress design method are the following:\\n1. The derivation of the strength design expressions takes into account the nonlinear shape\\nof the stress–strain diagram. When the resulting equations are applied, decidedly better\\nestimates of load-carrying ability are obtained.\\n2. With strength design, a more consistent theory is used throughout the designs of rein-\\nforced concrete structures. For instance, with working-stress design the transformed-area\\nor straight-line method was used for beam design, and a strength design procedure was\\nused for columns.\\n3. A more realistic factor of safety is used in strength design. The designer can certainly\\nestimate the magnitudes of the dead loads that a structure will have to support more\\naccurately than he or she can estimate the live and environmental loads. With working-\\nstress design, the same safety factor was used for dead, live, and environmental loads.\\nThis is not the case for strength design. For this reason, use of different load or safety\\nfactors in strength design for the different types of loads is a deﬁnite improvement.\\n4. A structure designed by the strength method will have a more uniform safety factor\\nagainst collapse throughout. The strength method takes considerable advantage of higher-\\nstrength steels, whereas working-stress design did so only partly. The result is better\\neconomy for strength design.\\n5. The strength method permits more ﬂexible designs than did the working-stress method.\\nFor instance, the percentage of steel may be varied quite a bit. As a result, large sections\\nmay be used with small percentages of steel, or small sections may be used with large\\npercentages of steel. Such variations were not the case in the relatively ﬁxed working-\\nstress method. If the same amount of steel is used in strength design for a particular\\nbeam as would have been used with WSD, a smaller section will result. If the same size\\nsection is used as required by WSD, a smaller amount of steel will be required.\\n3.3 Structural Safety\\nThe structural safety of a reinforced concrete structure can be calculated with two methods.\\nThe ﬁrst method involves calculations of the stresses caused by the working or service loads\\nand their comparison with certain allowable stresses. Usually the safety factor against collapse\\nwhen the working-stress method was used was said to equal the smaller off ′\\nc /fc or f ′\\ny /fs.\\nThe second approach to structural safety is the one used in strength design in which\\nuncertainty is considered. The working loads are multiplied by certain load factors that are\\nlarger than 1. The resulting larger or factored loads are used for designing the structure. The\\nvalues of the load factors vary depending on the type and combination of the loads.\\nTo accurately estimate the u ltimate strength of a structure, it is n ecessary to take into\\naccount the uncertainties in material strengths, dimensions, and workmanship. This is done\\nby multiplying the theoretical ultimate strength (called the nominal strength herein) of each'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 86}, page_content='McCormac c03.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 5:01 P.M.

Compression stresses\\nvary approximately in a straight line until the maximum stress equals about 0.50f ′\\nc . This is not\\nthe case, however, after stresses go higher. When the ultimate load is r eached, the strain and\\nstress variations are approximately as shown in Figure 3.1.\\nThe compressive stresses vary from zero at the neutral axis to a maximum value at or\\nnear the extreme ﬁber. The actual stress variation and the actual location of the neutral axis\\nvary somewhat from beam to beam, depending on such variables as the magnitude and history\\nof past loadings, shrinkage and creep of the concrete, size and spacing of tension cracks, speed\\nof loading, and so on.\\nIf the shape of the stress diagram were the same for every beam, it would be possible\\nto derive a single rational set of expressions for ﬂexural behavior. Because of these stress\\nvariations, however, it is necessary to base the strength design on a combination of theory and\\ntest results.\\nAlthough the actual stress distribution given in Figure 3.2(b) may seem to be important,\\nin practice any assumed shape (rectangular, parabolic, trapezoidal, etc.) can be used if the'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 87}, page_content=\"McCormac c03.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 5:01 P.M.

The most common shapes proposed\\nare the rectangle, parabola, and trapezoid, with the rectangular shape used in this text as shown\\nin Figure 3.2(c) being the most common one.\\nIf the concrete is assumed to crush at a strain of about 0.003 (which is a little conservative\\nfor most concretes) and the steel to yield at fy, it is possible to make a reasonable derivation\\nof beam formulas without knowing the exact stress distribution. However, it is n ecessary to\\nknow the value of the total compression force and its centroid.\\nWhitney1 replaced the curved stress block [Figure 3.2(b)] with an equivalent recta ngular\\nblock of intensity 0.85 f ′\\nc and depth α = β1c, as shown in Figure 3.2(c). The area of this\\nrectangular block should equal that of the curved stress block, and the centroids of the two\\nblocks should coincide. Sufﬁcient test results are available for concrete beams to provide the\\ndepths of the equivalent rectangular stress blocks. The values of β1 given by the code (10.2.7.3)\\nare intended to give this result. For f ′\\nc values of 4000 psi or less, β1 = 0.85, and it is to be\\nreduced continuously at a rate of 0.05 for each 1000-psi increase in f ′\\nc above 4000 psi. Their\\nvalue may not be less than 0.65. The values of β1 are reduced for high-strength concretes\\nprimarily because of the shapes of their stress–strain curves (see Figure 1.1 in Chapter 1).\\nFor concretes with f ′\\nc > 4000 psi, β1 can be determined with the following formula:\\nβ1 = 0.85 −\\n(f ′\\nc − 4000 psi\\n1000\\n⎡\\n(0.05) ≥ 0.65\\na = β1cc\\n(a) (b) (c)\\nT = As fy T = As fy\\nf'c f'c0.85\\nFIGURE 3 . 2 Some possible stress distribution shapes.\\n1 Whitney, C.

Mn is deﬁned as the theoretical or nominal resisting moment of\\na section. In Section 3.3, it was stated that the usable strength of a member equals its theoretical\\nstrength times the strength reduction factor, or, in this case, φMn. The usable ﬂexural strength\\nof a member, φMn, must at least be equal to the calculated factored moment, Mu, caused by\\nthe factored loads\\nφMn ≥ Mu\\nFor writing the beam expressions, reference is made to Figure 3.3.

This expression forρ is also very\\nuseful for tensilely reinforced rectangular sections that do not fall into the tables. An iter-\\native technique for determination of reinforcing steel area is also presented later in this\\nchapter.\\n3.5 Strains in Flexural Members\\nAs previously mentioned, Section 10.2.2 of the code states that the strains in concrete members\\nand their reinforcement are to be assumed to vary directly with distances from their neutral\\naxes. (This assumption is not applicable to deep ﬂexural members whose depths over their clear\\nspans are greater than 0.25.) Furthermore, in Section 10.2.3 the code states that the maximum\\nusable strain in the extreme compression ﬁbers of a ﬂexural member is to be 0.003. Finally,\\nSection 10.3.3 states that for Grade 60 reinforcement and for all prestressed reinforcement we\\nmay set the strain in the steel equal to 0.002 at the balanced condition. (Theoretically, for\\n60,000-psi steel, it equals fy /Es = 60,000 psi/29 × 106 psi = 0.00207.)\\nIn Section 3.4, a value was derived for a, the depth of the equivalent stress block of a\\nbeam. It can be related to c with the factor β1 also given in that section:\\na =\\nAs fy\\n0.85f ′c b = β1c\\nThen the distance c from the extreme concrete compression ﬁbers to the neutral axis is\\nc = a\\nβ1\\nIn Example 3.1, the values of a and c are determined for the beam previously considered\\nin Example 2.8, and by straight-line proportions the strain in the reinforcing ϵt is computed.\\nExample 3.1\\nDetermine the values of a, c,a n dϵt f o rt h eb e a ms h o w ni nF i g u r e3 . 4 .fy = 60,000 psi and\\nf′\\nc = 3000 psi.\\nSOLUTION\\na =\\nAsfy\\n0.85f′\\ncb = (3.00 in.2)( 6 0k s i )\\n(0.85) (3 ksi) (14 in.)= 5.04 in.\\nβ1 = 0.85 for 3000-psi concrete'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 90}, page_content='McCormac c03.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 5:01 P.M.

This is an indication of ductile\\nbehavior of the beam, because the steel is well into its yield plateau before concrete crushes.\\n3.6 Balanced Sections, Tension-Controlled Sections,\\nand Compression-Controlled or Brittle Sections\\nA beam that has a balanced steel ratio is one for which the tensile steel will theoretically just\\nreach its yield point at the same time the extreme compression concrete ﬁbers attain a strain\\nequal to 0.003. Should a ﬂexural member be so designed that it has a balanced steel ratio or\\nbe a member whose compression side controls (i.e., if its compression strain reaches 0.003\\nbefore the steel yields), the member can suddenly fail without warning. As the load on such a\\nmember is increased, its deﬂections will usually not be particularly noticeable, even t hough the\\nconcrete is highly stressed in compression and failure will probably occur without warning to\\nusers of the structure. These members are compression controlled and are referred to as brittle\\nmembers. Obviously, such members must be avoided.\\nThe code, in Section 10.3.4, states that members whose computed tensile strains are equal\\nto or greater than 0.0050 at the same time the concrete strain is 0.003 are to be referred to as\\ntension-controlled sections. For such members, the steel will yield before the compression side\\ncrushes and deﬂections will be large, giving users warning of impending failure. Furthermore,\\nmembers with ϵt ≥ 0.005 are considered to be fully ductile. The ACI chose the 0.005 value\\nfor ϵt to apply to all types of steel permitted by the code, whether regular or prestressed. The\\ncode further states that members that have net steel strains or ϵt values between ϵy and 0.005\\nare in a transition region between compression-controlled and tension-controlled sections. For\\nGrade 60 reinforcing steel, which is quite common, ϵy is approximated by 0.002.\\n3.7 Strength Reduction or φ Factors\\nStrength reduction factors are used to take into account the uncertainties of material strengths,\\ninaccuracies in the design equations, approximations in analysis, possible variations in dimen-\\nsions of the concrete sections and placement of reinforcement, the importance of members in'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 91}, page_content=\"McCormac c03.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 5:01 P.M.

The code (9.3) prescribes φ values or strength\\nreduction factors for most situations. Among these values are the following:\\n0.90 for tension-controlled beams and slabs\\n0.75 for shear and torsion in beams\\n0.65 or 0.75 for columns\\n0.65 or 0.75 to 0.9 for columns supporting very small axial loads\\n0.65 for bearing on concrete\\nThe sizes of these factors are rather good indications of our knowledge of the subject in\\nquestion. For instance, calculated nominal moment capacities in reinforced concrete members\\nseem to be quite accurate, whereas computed bearing capacities are more questionable.\\nFor ductile or tension-controlled beams and slabs where ϵt ≥ 0.005, the value of φ for\\nbending is 0.90. Should ϵt be less than 0.005, it is still possible to use the sections if ϵt is\\nnot less than certain values. This situation is shown in Figure 3.5, which is similar to Figure\\nR.9.3.2 in the ACI Commentary to the 2011 code.\\nMembers subject to axial loads equal to or less than 0.10 f ′\\nc Ag may be used only when\\nϵt is no lower than 0.004 (ACI Section 10.3.5). An important implication of this limit is that\\nreinforced concrete beams must have a tension strain of at least 0.004. Should the members be\\nsubject to axial loads≥ 0.10f ′\\nc Ag,t h e nϵt is not limited. When ϵt values fall between 0.002 and\\n0.005, they are said to be in the transition range between tension-controlled and compression-\\ncontrolled sections. In this range,φ values will fall between 0.65 or 0.70 and 0.90, as shown\\nin Figure 3.5. When ϵt ≤ 0.002, the member is compression controlled, and the column φ\\nfactors apply.\\nThe procedure for determining φ values in the transition range is described later in this\\nsection. You must clearly understand that the use of ﬂexural members in this range is usually\\nuneconomical, and it is probably better, if the situation permits, to increase member depths\\nand/or decrease steel percentages untilϵt is equal to or larger than 0.005 . If this is done, not\\nonly will φ values equal 0.9 but also steel percentages will not be so large as to cause crowding\\nof reinforcing bars. The net result will be slightly larger concrete sections, with consequent\\nsmaller deﬂections. Furthermore, as you will learn in subsequent chapters, the bond of the\\nreinforcing to the concrete will be increased as compared to cases where higher percentages\\nof steel are used.\\n150\\n3\\nφ\\n0.90\\n0.75\\n0.65\\ncompression\\ncontrolled transition tension controlled\\nSpiral 2011 code\\nother lower bound on ²t for\\nmembers with factored axial\\ncompressive load < 0.10 f'cAg \\n250\\n3\\n²t = 0.002 ²t = 0.004 ²t = 0.005\\nc⎢dt = 0.600 c⎢dt = 3⎢7 c⎢dt = 0.375\\n(²t – 0.002)\\n(²t – 0.002)\\nFIGURE 3 . 5 Variation of φ with net tensile strain ϵt and c/dt for\\nGrade 60 reinforcement and for prestressing steel.\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 92}, page_content=\"McCormac c03.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 5:01 P.M.

You may prefer to compute c/dt for a particular beam to check\\nits ductility rather than computing ρ or ϵt. In the transition region, interpolation to determine\\nφ using c/dt instead of ϵt, when 0.375 < c/dt < 0.600, can be performed using the equations\\nφ = 0.75 + 0.15\\n( 1\\nc/dt\\n− 5\\n3\\n⎡\\nfor spiral members\\nφ = 0.65 + 0.25\\n( 1\\nc/dt\\n− 5\\n3\\n⎡\\nfor other members\\nThe equations for φ here and in Figure 3.5 are for the special case where fy = 60 ksi and for\\nprestressed concrete.

It is important for the designer to know this b ecause often actual bar selections\\nresult in more steel area than theoretically required. If the slope between points A and C were\\nnegative, the designer could not use a larger area.

It is therefore especially important, when using high-strength reinforcing\\nsteel, to verify your ﬁnal design to be sure the bars you have selected do not result in a moment\\ncapacity less than the design value.\\nContinuing our consideration of Figure 3.5, you can see that when ϵt is less than 0.005,\\nthe values of φ will vary along a straight line from their 0.90 value for ductile sections to 0.65\\nat balanced conditions where ϵt is 0.002. Later you will learn that φ can equal 0.75 rather than\\n0.65 at this latter strain situation if spirally reinforced sections are being considered.\\n3.8 Minimum Percentage of Steel\\nA brief discussion of the modes of failure that occur for various reinforced beams was pre-\\nsented in Section 3.6. Sometimes, because of architectural or functional requirements, beam\\ndimensions are selected that are much larger than are required for bending alone. Such members\\ntheoretically require very small amounts of reinforcing.\\nActually, another mode of failure can occur in very lightly reinforced beams. If the\\nultimate resisting moment of the section is less than its cracking moment, the section will fail\\nimmediately when a crack occurs. This type of failure may occur without warning. To prevent\\nsuch a possibility, the ACI (10.5.1) speciﬁes a certain minimum amount of reinforcing that\\nmust be used at every section of ﬂexural members where tensile reinforcing is required by\\nanalysis, whether for positive or negative moments. In the following equations, bw represents\\nthe web width of beams.\\nAs min = 3\\n√\\nf ′c\\nfy\\nbw d\\nnor less than 200bw d\\nfy\\n(ACI Equation 10-3)\\nIn SI units, these expressions are\\n(√\\nf ′c\\n4fy\\n⎡\\nbw d and\\n(\\n1.4bw d\\nfy\\n⎡\\n, respectively.\\nThe (200bw d)/fy value was obtained by calculating the cracking moment of a plain\\nconcrete section and equating it to the strength of a reinforced concrete section of the same\\nsize, applying a safety factor of 2.5 and solving for the steel required. It has been found,\\nhowever, that when f ′\\nc is higher than about 5000 psi, this value may not be sufﬁcient. Thus, the(\\n3\\n√\\nf ′c /fy\\n⎡\\nbw d value is also required to be met, and it will actually control when f ′\\nc is greater\\nthan 4440 psi.\\nThis ACI equation (10-3) for the minimum amount of ﬂexural reinforcing can be written\\nas a percentage, as follows:\\nρmin for ﬂexure = 3\\n√\\nf ′c\\nfy\\n≥ 200\\nfy\\nVal u es o fρmin for ﬂexure have been calculated by the authors and are shown for several grades of\\nconcrete and steel in Appendix A, Table A.7 of this text.

Furthermore, ACI Section 10.5.4 states that for slabs and footings\\nof uniform thickness, the minimum area of tensile reinforcing in the direction of the span is\\nthat speciﬁed in ACI Section 7.12 for shrinkage and temperature steel which is much lower.\\nWhen slabs are overloaded in certain areas, there is a tendency for those loads to be distributed\\nlaterally to other parts of the slab, thus substantially reducing the chances of sudden failure.\\nThis explains why a reduction of the minimum reinforcing percentage is permitted in slabs of\\nuniform thickness. Supported slabs, such as slabs on grade, are not considered to be structural\\nslabs in this section unless they transmit vertical loads from other parts of the structure to the\\nunderlying soil.\\n3.9 Balanced Steel Percentage\\nIn this section, an expression is derived for ρb, the percentage of steel required for a balanced\\ndesign. At ultimate load for such a beam, the concrete will theoretically fail (at a strain of\\n0.00300), and the steel will simultaneously yield (see Figure 3.7).\\nThe neutral axis is located by the triangular strain relationships that follow, noting that\\nEs = 29 × 106 psi for the reinforcing bars:\\nc\\nd = 0.00300\\n0.00300 + (fy /Es ) = 0.00300\\n0.003 + (fy /29 × 106 psi)\\nThis expression is rearranged and simpliﬁed, giving\\nc = 87,000\\n87,000 + fy\\nd'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 95}, page_content='McCormac c03.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 5:01 P.M.

Page 82\\nCHAPTER 4\\n Design of Rectangular Beams\\nand One-Way Slabs\\n4.1 Load Factors\\nLoad factors are numbers, almost always larger than 1.0, that are used to increase the estimated\\nloads applied to structures. They are used for loads applied to all types of members, not just\\nbeams and slabs. The loads are increased to attempt to account for the uncertainties involved\\nin estimating their magnitudes. How close can you estimate the largest wind or seismic loads\\nthat will ever be applied to the building that you are now occupying? How much uncertainty\\nis present in your answer?\\nYou should note that the load factors for dead loads are much smaller than the ones used\\nfor live and environmental loads. Obviously, the reason is that we can estimate the magnitudes\\nof dead loads much more accurately than we can the magnitudes of those other loads. In this\\nregard, you will notice that the magnitudes of loads that remain in place for long periods of\\ntime are much less variable than are those loads applied for brief periods, such as wind and\\nsnow.\\nSection 9.2 of the code presents the load factors and combinations that are to be used for\\nreinforced concrete design. The required strength, U, or the load-carrying ability of a particular\\nreinforced concrete member, must at least equal the largest value obtained by substituting\\ninto ACI Equations 9-1 to 9-7. The following equations conform to the requirements of the\\nInternational Building Code (IBC) 1 as well as to the values required by ASCE/SEI 7-10. 2\\nU = 1.4D (ACI Equation 9-1)\\nU = 1.2D + 1.6L + 0.5(Lr or S or R) (ACI Equation 9-2)\\nU = 1.2D + 1.6(Lr or S or R) + (L or 0.5W ) (ACI Equation 9-3)\\nU = 1.2D + 1.0W + L + 0.5(Lr or S or R) (ACI Equation 9-4)\\nU = 1.2D + 1.0E + L + 0.2S (ACI Equation 9-5)\\nU = 0.9D + 1.0W (ACI Equation 9-6)\\nU = 0.9D + 1.0E (ACI Equation 9-7)\\nIn the preceding expressions, the following values are used:\\nU = the design or ultimate load the structure needs to be able to resist\\nD = dead load\\nL = live load\\n1 International Code Council, 2012, International Building Code , Falls Church, Virginia 22041-3401.\\n2 American Society of Civil Engineers, Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures , ASCE 7-10 (Reston, V A:\\nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers), p. 7.\\n82'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 102}, page_content='McCormac c04.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 8:44 P.M.

Such situations occur when those loads are quickly applied, as they are\\nfor parking garages, elevators, loading docks, cranes, and others.\\nThe load combinations presented in ACI Equations 9-6 and 9-7 contain a 0.9 D value.\\nThis 0.9 factor accounts for cases where larger dead loads tend to reduce the effects of other\\nloads. One obvious example of such a situation may occur in tall buildings that are subject\\nto lateral wind and seismic forces where overturning may be a possibility. As a result, the\\ndead loads are reduced by 10% to take into account situations where they may have been\\noverestimated.\\nThe reader must realize that the sizes of the load factors do not vary in relation to the\\nseriousness of failure. You may think that larger load factors should be used for hospitals or high-\\nrise buildings than for cattle barns, but such is not the case. The load factors were developed on\\nthe assumption that designers would consider the seriousness of possible failure in specifying\\nthe magnitude of their service loads. Furthermore, the ACI load factors are minimum values,\\nand designers are perfectly free to use larger factors as they desire. The magnitude of wind loads\\nand seismic loads, however, reﬂects the importance of the structure. For example, in ASCE-7, 3\\na hospital must be designed for an earthquake load 50% larger than a comparable building\\nwith less serious consequences of failure.\\nFor some special situations, ACI Section 9.2 permits reductions in the speciﬁed load\\nfactors. These situations are as follows:\\n(a) In ACI Equations 9-3 to 9-5, the factor used for live loads may be reduced to 0.5 except\\nfor garages, areas used for public assembly, and all areas where the live loads exceed\\n100 psf.\\n(b) If the load W is based on service-level wind loads, replace 1.0 W in ACI Equations 9-4\\nand 9-6 with 1.6 W. Also, replace 0.5 W with 0.8W in ACI Equation 9-3.\\n(c) Frequently, building codes and design load references convert seismic loads to strength-\\nlevel values (i.e., in effect they have already been multiplied by a load factor). This is\\nthe situation assumed in ACI Equations 9-5 and 9-7. If, however, service-load seismic\\nforces are speciﬁed, it will be necessary to replace 1.0E with 1.4E in these two equations.\\n(d) Self-restraining effects, T, in reinforced concrete structures include the effects of tem-\\nperature, creep, shrinkage, and differential settlement. In some cases, the effects can be\\nadditive. For example, creep, shrinkage, and reduction in temperature all cause a reduc-\\ntion of concrete volume. Often such effects can be reduced or eliminated by proper use\\nof control joints.\\n(e) Fluid loads, F, resulting from the weight and pressure of ﬂuids shall be included with\\nthe same load factor as D in ACI Equations 9-5 through 9-7.\\n3 American Society of Civil Engineers, Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures .

Page 85\\n4.2 Design of Rectangular Beams 85\\n4.2 Design of Rectangular Beams\\nBefore the design of an actual beam is attempted, several miscellaneous topics need to be\\ndiscussed. These include the following:\\n1. Beam proportions. Unless architectural or other requirements dictate the proportions of\\nreinforced concrete beams, the most economical beam sections are usually obtained for shorter\\nbeams (up to 20 ft or 25 ft in length), when the ratio ofd to b is in the range of 1 1\\n2 to 2.\\nFor longer spans, better economy is usually obtained if deep, narrow sections are used. The\\ndepths may be as large as three or four times the widths. However, today’s reinforced concrete\\ndesigner is often confronted with the need to keep members rather shallow to reduce ﬂoor\\nheights. As a result, wider and shallower beams are used more frequently than in the past. You\\nwill notice that the overall beam dimensions are selected to whole inches. This is done for\\nsimplicity in constructing forms or for the rental of forms, which are usually available in 1-in.\\nor 2-in. increments. Furthermore, beam widths are often selected in multiples of 2 in. or 3 in.\\n2. Deﬂections. Considerable space is devoted in Chapter 6 to the topic of deﬂections\\nin reinforced concrete members subjected to bending. However, the ACI Code in its Table\\n9.5(a) provides minimum thicknesses of beams and one-way slabs for which such deﬂection\\ncalculations are not required. These values are shown in Table 4.1. The purpose of such\\nlimitations is to prevent deﬂections of such magnitudes as would interfere with the use of or\\ncause injury to the structure. If deﬂections are computed for members of lesser thicknesses\\nthan those listed in the table and are found to be satisfactory, it is not necessary to abide by\\nthe thickness rules. For simply supported slabs, normal-weight concrete, and Grade 60 steel,\\nthe minimum depth given when deﬂections are not computed equalsl/20, where l is the span\\nlength of the slab. For concrete of other weights and for steel of different yield strengths, the\\nminimum depths required by the ACI Code are somewhat revised, as indicated in the footnotes\\nto Table 4.1. The ACI does not specify changes in the table for concretes weighing between\\n120 lb/ft and 145 lb/ft because substitution into the correction expression given yields correction\\nfactors almost equal to 1.0.\\nThe minimum thicknesses provided apply only to members that are not supporting or\\nattached to partitions or other construction likely to be damaged by large deﬂections.\\n3. Estimated beam weight. The weight of the beam to be selected must be included in the\\ncalculation of the bending moment to be resisted, because the beam must s upport itself as well\\nas the external loads. The weight estimates for the beams selected in this text are generally\\nvery close because the authors were able to perform alittle preliminary paperwork before\\nTABLE 4. 1 Minimum Thickness of Nonprestressed Beams or One-Way Slabs Unless\\nDeﬂections Are Computed1,2\\nMinimum Thickness,h\\nSimply\\n One end\\n Both ends\\nsupported\\n continuous\\n continuous\\n Cantilever\\nMembers not supporting or attached to partitions or other\\nMember\\n construction likely to be damaged by large deﬂections\\nSolid one-way slabs\\n l/20\\n l/24\\n l/28\\n l/10\\nBeams or ribbed\\none-way slabs\\n l/16\\n l/18.5\\n l/21\\n l/8\\n1Span length,l, is in inches.\\n2Values given shall be used directly for members with normal-weight concrete and Grade 60 reinforcement.

You are not expected to be able to glance at a problem and give an\\nexact estimate of the weight of the beam required. Following the same procedures as did the\\nauthors, however, you can do a little ﬁguring on the side and make a very reasonable estimate.\\nFor instance, you could calculate the moment due to the external loads only, select a beam\\nsize, and calculate its weight. From this beam size, you should be able to make a very good\\nestimate of the weight of the ﬁnal beam section.\\nAnother practical method for estimating beam sizes is to assume a minimum overall\\ndepth, h, equal to the minimum depth speciﬁed by Table 4.1 [ACI-318-11, Table 9.5(a)] if\\ndeﬂections are not to be calculated. The ACI minimum for the beam in question may be\\ndetermined by referring to Table 4.1. Then the beam width can be roughly estimated equal to\\nabout one-half of the assumed value of h and the weight of this estimated beam calculated =\\nbh/144 times the concrete weight per cubic foot. Because concrete weighs approximately 150\\npcf (if the weight of steel is included), a quick-and-dirty calculation of self-weight is simply\\nb × h because the concrete weight approximately cancels the 144 c onversion factor.\\nAfter Mu is determined for all of the loads, including the estimated beam weight, the\\nsection is selected. If the dimensions of this section are signiﬁcantly different from those\\ninitially assumed, it will be necessary to recalculate the weight and Mu and repeat the beam\\nselection. At this point you may very logically ask, “What’s a signiﬁcant change?” Well, you\\nmust realize that we are not interested academically in how close our estimated weight is to\\nthe ﬁnal weight, but rather we are extremely interested in how close our calculated Mu is to\\nthe actual Mu. In other words, our estimated weight may be considerably in error, but if it\\ndoesn’t affect Mu by more than say 1% or 1 1\\n2 %, forget it.\\nIn Example 4.2, beam proportions are estimated as just described, and the dimensions so\\nselected are taken as the ﬁnal ones. As a result, you can see that it is not necessary to check\\nthe beam weight and recalculate Mu and repeat the design.\\nIn Example 4.3, a beam is designed for which the total value of Mu (including the beam\\nweight) has been provided, as well as a suggested steel percentage.\\nFinally, with Example 4.4, the authors have selected a beam whose weight is unknown.\\nWithout a doubt, many students initially have a little difﬁculty understanding how to make\\nreasonable member weight estimates for cases such as this one. To show how easily, quickly,\\nand accurately this may be done for beams, this example is included.\\nWe dreamed up a beam weight estimated out of the blue equal to 400 lb/ft. (We could\\njust as easily and successfully have made it 10 lb/ft or 1000 lb/ft.) With this value, a beam\\nsection was selected and its weight calculated to equal 619 lb/ft. With this value, a very good\\nweight estimate was then made. The new section obviously would be a little larger than the ﬁrst\\none. So we estimated the weight a little above the 619 lb/ft value, r ecalculated the moment,\\nselected a new section, and determined its weight. The results were very satisfactory.\\n4. Selection of bars. After the required reinforcing area is calculated, Appendix A,\\nTable A.4 is used to select bars that provide the n ecessary area. For the usual situations, bars\\nof sizes #11 and smaller are practical. It is usually convenient to use bars of one size only in\\na beam, although o ccasionally two sizes will be used. Bars for compression steel and stirrups\\nare usually a different size, however. Otherwise the ironworkers may become confused.\\n5. Cover. The reinforcing for concrete members must be protected from the surround-\\ning environment; that is, ﬁre and corrosion protection need to be provided. To do this, the\\nreinforcing is located at certain minimum distances from the surface of the concrete so that\\na protective layer of concrete, called cover, is provided. In addition, the cover improves the\\nbond between the concrete and the steel. In Section 7.7 of the ACI Code, speciﬁed cover is\\ngiven for reinforcing bars under different conditions. V alues are given for reinforced concrete\\nbeams, columns, and slabs; for cast-in-place members; for precast members; for prestressed\\nmembers; for members exposed to earth and weather; for members not so exposed; and so on.\\nThe concrete for members that are to be exposed to deicing salts, brackish water, seawater, or'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 106}, page_content='McCormac c04.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 8:44 P.M.

These requirements pertain to air entrainment, water–cement ratios,\\ncement types, concrete strength, and so on.\\nThe beams designed in Examples 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 are assumed to be located inside a\\nbuilding and thus protected from the weather. For this case, the code requires a minimum cover\\nof 11\\n2 in. of concrete outside of any reinforcement.\\nIn Chapter 8, you will learn that vertical stirrups are used in most beams for shear\\nreinforcing. A sketch of a stirrup is shown in the beam of Figure 4.1. The minimum stirrup\\ndiameter ( ds) that the code permits us to use is 3\\n8 in. when the longitudinal bars are #10 or\\nsmaller; for #11 and larger bars, the minimum stirrup diameter is 1\\n2 in. The minimum inside\\nradius of the 90 ◦ stirrup bent around the outside longitudinal bars is two times the stirrup\\ndiameter (2ds). As a result, when the longitudinal bars are #14 or smaller, there will be a gap\\nbetween the bars and the stirrups, as shown in the ﬁgure. This is based on the assumption that\\neach outside l ongitudinal bar is centered over the horizontal point of tangency of the stirrup\\ncorner bend. For #18 bars, however, the half-bar diameter is larger than 2 ds and controls.\\nFor the beam of Figure 4.1 it is assumed that 1.50-in. clear cover, #3 stirrups, and #10\\nlongitudinal bars are used. The minimum horizontal distance from the center of the outside\\nlongitudinal bars to the edge of the concrete can be determined as follows:\\nMinimum edge distance = cover + ds + 2ds = 1.50 in. + 3\\n8 in. + (2)\\n(3\\n8 in.\\n⎡\\n= 2 5\\n8 in.\\nThe minimum cover required for concrete cast against earth, as in a footing, is 3 in., and for\\nconcrete not cast against the earth but later exposed to it, as by backﬁll, 2 in.

Their\\npurpose is to provide support for the stirrups and to hold the stirrups in position.\\nIf concrete members are exposed to very harsh surroundings, such as deicing salts, smoke,\\nor acid vapors, the cover should be increased above these minimums.\\n6. Minimum spacing of bars. The code (7.6) states that the clear distance between parallel\\nbars cannot be less than 1 in. [4] or less than the nominal bar diameter. If the bars are placed\\nin more than one layer, those in the upper layers are required to be pl aced directly over the\\nones in the lower layers, and the clear distance between the layers must be not less than 1 in.\\n4\\n 25 mm in SI.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 107}, page_content='McCormac c04.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 8:44 P.M.

Note the supporting metal chairs.\\nA major purpose of these requirements is to enable the concrete to pass between the\\nbars. The ACI Code further relates the spacing of the bars to the maximum aggregate sizes for\\nthe same purpose. In the code Section 3.3.2, maximum permissible aggregate sizes are limited\\nto the smallest of (a) one-ﬁfth of the narrowest distance between side forms, (b) one-third of\\nslab depths, and (c) three-fourths of the minimum clear spacing between bars.\\nA reinforcing bar must extend an appreciable length in both directions from its point of\\nhighest stress in order to develop its stress by bonding to the concrete. The shortest length in\\nwhich a bar’s stress can be increased from 0 to fy is called its development length.\\nIf the distance from the end of a bar to a point where it theoretically has a stress equal\\nto fy is less than its required development length, the bar may very well pull loose from the\\nconcrete. Development lengths are discussed in detail in Chapter 7. There you will learn that\\nrequired development lengths for reinforcing bars vary appreciably with their spacings and\\ntheir cover. As a result, it is sometimes wise to use greater cover and larger bar spacings than\\nthe speciﬁed minimum values in order to reduce development lengths .\\nWhen selecting the actual bar spacing, the designer will comply with the preceding code\\nrequirements and, in addition, will give spacings and other dimensions in inches and fractions,\\nnot in decimals. The workers in the ﬁeld are accustomed to working with fractions and would\\nbe confused by a spacing of bars such as 3 at 1.45 in. The designer should always strive for\\nsimple spacings, for such dimensions will lead to better economy.\\nEach time a beam is designed, it is necessary to select the spacing and arrange-\\nment of the bars. To simplify these calculations, Appendix A, Table A.5 is given.\\nCorresponding information is provided in SI units in Appendix B, Table B.5. These tables\\nshow the minimum beam widths required for different numbers of bars. The values given are\\nbased on the assumptions that 3\\n8 -in. stirrups and 1 1\\n2 -in. cover are required except for #18 bars,\\nwhere the stirrup diameter is 1\\n2 in.

It is much easier to accurately read the tables than the graphs (at least\\nto the scale to which the graphs are shown in this text). For this reason, the tables are used\\nfor the examples here. The units forMu/φbd2 in both the tables and the graphs of Appendix\\nA are pounds per square inch.\\n In Appendix B, the units are MPa.\\nOnce Mu/φbd2 is determined for a particular beam, the value of Mu can be calculated as\\nillustrated in the alternate solution for Example 3.1. The same tables and graphs can be used\\nfor either the design or analysis of beams.\\nThe value of ρ, determined in Example 4.2 by substituting into that long and tedious\\nequation, can be directly selected from Appendix A, Table A.13. We enter that table with the\\nMu/φbd2 value previously calculated in the example, and we read a value of ρ between 0.0084\\nand 0.0085. Interpolation can be used to ﬁnd the actual value of 0.00842, but suchaccuracy is not\\nreally necessary. It is conservative to use the higher value (0.0085) to calculate the steel area.\\nIn Example 4.3, which follows, a value of ρ was speciﬁed in the problem statement, and\\nthe long equation was used to determine the required dimensions of the structure as represented\\nby bd2. Again, it is much easier to use the appropriate appendix table to determine this value. In\\nnearly every other case in this textbook, the tables are used for design or analysis purposes.\\nOnce the numerical value of bd2 is determined, the authors take what seems to be\\nreasonable values for b (in this case 12 in., 14 in., and 16 in.) and compute the required d\\nfor each width so that the required bd2 is satisﬁed. Finally, a section is selected in which b\\nis roughly 1\\n2 to 2\\n3 of d.

Page 93\\n4.3 Beam Design Examples 93\\nThrough quite a few d ecades of reinforced concrete design experience, it has been f ound\\nthat if steel percentages are kept fairly small, say roughly 0.18 f ′\\nc /fy or perhaps 0.375 ρb, beam\\ncross sections will be sufﬁciently large so that deﬂections will seldom be a problem. As the\\nareas of steel required will be fairly small, there will be little problem ﬁtting them into beams\\nwithout crowding.\\nIf these relatively small percentages of steel are used, there will be little difﬁculty in\\nplacing the bars and in getting the concrete between them. Of course, from the standpoint\\nof deﬂection, higher percentages of steel, and thus smaller beams, can be used for short\\nspans where deﬂections present no problem. Whatever steel percentages are used, the resulting\\nmembers will have to be carefully checked for deﬂections, particularly for long-span beams,\\ncantilever beams, and shallow beams and slabs. Of course, such deﬂection checks are not\\nrequired if the minimum depths speciﬁed in Table 4.1 of this chapter are met.\\nAnother reason for using smaller percentages of steel is given in ACI Section 8.4, where\\na plastic redistribution of moments (a subject to be discussed in Chapter 14) is permitted in\\ncontinuous members whoseϵt values are 0.0075 or greater. Such tensile strains will occur\\nwhen smaller percentages of steel are used. For the several reasons mentioned here, structural\\ndesigners believe that keeping steel percentages fairly low will result in good economy.\\nExample 4.4\\nA rectangular beam is to be sized withfy = 60,000 psi, f′\\nc = 3000 psi, and aρ approximately\\nequal to 0.18f′\\nc/fy.

Page 95\\n4.4 Miscellaneous Beam Considerations 95\\n4.4 Miscellaneous Beam Considerations\\nThis section introduces two general limitations relating to beam design: lateral bracing and\\ndeep beams.\\nLateral Support\\nIt is unlikely that laterally unbr aced reinforced concrete beams of any normal pr oportions will\\nbuckle laterally, even if they are deep and narrow, unless they are subject to appreciable lateral\\ntorsion. As a result, the ACI Code (10.4.1) states that lateral bracing for a beam is not required\\ncloser than 50 times the least width,b, of the compression ﬂange or face. S hould appreciable\\ntorsion be present, however, it must be considered in determining the maximum spacing for\\nlateral support.\\nSkin Reinforcement for Deep Beams\\nBeams with web depths that exceed 3 ft have a tendency to develop excessively wide cracks\\nin the upper parts of their tension zones. To reduce these cracks, it is n ecessary to add some\\nadditional longitudinal reinforcing in the zone of ﬂexural tension near the vertical side faces of\\ntheir webs, as shown in Figure 4.4. The code (10.6.7) states that additional skin reinforcement\\nmust be uniformly distributed along both side faces of members withh > 36 in. for distances\\nequal to h/2 nearest the ﬂexural reinforcing.\\nThe spacing, s, between this skin reinforcement shall be as provided in ACI 10.6.4. These\\nadditional bars may be used in computing the bending strengths of members only if appropriate\\nstrains for their positions relative to neutral axes are used to determine bar stresses. The total\\narea of the skin reinforcement in both side faces of the beam does not have to exceed one-half\\nof the required bending tensile reinforcement in the beam. The ACI does not specify the actual\\narea of skin reinforcing; it merely states that some additional reinforcement should be placed\\nnear the vertical faces of the tension zone to prevent cracking in the beam webs.\\nSome special requirements must be considered relating to shear in deep beams, as\\ndescribed in the ACI Code (11.7) and in Section 8.14 of this text. Should these latter pro-\\nvisions require more reinforcing than required by ACI Section 10.6.7, the larger values will\\ngovern.\\nFor a beam designed in SI units with an effective depth > 1 m, additional skin reinforce-\\nment must be determined with the following expression, in which Ask is the area of skin\\nreinforcement per meter of height on each side of the beam:\\nIts maximum spacing may not exceed d/6 on 300 mm or 1000 Ab/(d − 750).\\nh\\nh\\n2\\ncomputed As\\nskin reinforcement\\neach side = Ask\\ns\\ns\\ns\\nb\\nFIGURE 4 . 4 Skin reinforcement for deep\\nbeams with h >36 in., as required by ACI\\nCode Section 10.6.7.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 115}, page_content='McCormac c04.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 8:44 P.M. Page 96\\n96 CHAPTER 4 Design of Rectangular Beams and One-Way Slabs\\nOther Items\\nThe next four chapters of this book are devoted to several other important items relating to\\nbeams. These include different shaped beams, compression reinforcing, cracks, bar development\\nlengths, and shear.\\nFurther Notes on Beam Sizes\\nFrom the standpoints of economy and appearance, only a few different sizes of beams should\\nbe used in a particular ﬂoor system. Such a practice will save appreciable amounts of money\\nby simplifying the formwork and at the same time will provide a ﬂoor system that has a more\\nuniform and attractive appearance.\\nIf a group of college students studying the subject of reinforced concrete were to design\\na ﬂoor system and then compare their work with a design of the same ﬂoor system made by an\\nexperienced structural designer, the odds are that the major difference between the two designs\\nwould be in the number of beam sizes. The practicing designer would probably use only a few\\ndifferent sizes, whereas the average student would probably use a larger number.\\nThe designer would probably examine the building layout to decide where to place the\\nbeams and then would make the beam subject to the largest bending moment as small as\\npractically possible (i.e., with a fairly high percentage of reinforcing). Then he or she would\\nproportion as many as possible of the other similar beams with the same outside dimensions.\\nThe reinforcing percentages of these latter beams might vary quite a bit because of their\\ndifferent moments.\\n4.5 Determining Steel Area When Beam Dimensions\\nAre Predetermined\\nSometimes the external dimensions of a beam are predetermined by factors other than\\nmoments and shears. The depth of a member may have been selected on the basis of the\\nminimum thickness requirements discussed in Section 4.2 for deﬂections. The size of a whole\\ngroup of beams may have been selected to simplify the formwork, as discussed in Section\\n4.4. Finally, a speciﬁc size may have been chosen for architectural reasons. Next we brieﬂy\\nmention three methods for computing the reinforcing required. Example 4.5 illustrates the\\napplication of each of these met hods.\\nAppendix Tables\\nThe value of Mu/φbd2 can be computed, and ρ can be selected from the tables. For most\\nsituations this is the quickest and most practical method. The tables given in Appendices A\\nand B of this text apply only to tensilely reinforced rectangular sections. Furthermore, we must\\nremember to checkφ values.\\nUse ofρ Formula\\nThe following equation was previously developed in Section 3.4 for rectangular sections.\\nρ = 0.85f ′\\nc\\nfy\\n(\\n1 −\\n√\\n1 − 2Rn\\n0.85f ′c\\n⎡'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 116}, page_content='McCormac c04.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 8:44 P.M. Page 97\\n4.5 Determining Steel Area When Beam Dimensions Are Predetermined97\\nTrial-and-Error (Iterative) Method\\nA value of a can be assumed, the value of As computed, the value of a determined for that\\nvalue of As, another value of a calculated, and so on. Alternatively, a value of the lever arm\\nfrom C to T (it’s d − a/2 for rectangular sections) can be estimated and used in the trial-and-\\nerror procedure. This method is a general one that will work for all cross sections with tensile\\nreinforcing. It is particularly useful for T beams, as will be illustrated in the next chapter.\\nExample 4.5\\nThe dimensions of the beam shown in Figure 4.5 have been selected for architectural reasons.\\nDetermine the reinforcing steel area by each of the methods described in this section.\\nSOLUTION\\nUsing Appendix Tables\\nMu\\nφbd2 = (12 in/ft) (160,000 ft-lb)\\n(0.9) (16 in.)

For such situations, groups of parallel bars may\\nbe bundled together. Up to four bars can be bundled, provided they are enclosed by stirrups\\nor ties. The ACI Code (7.6.6.3) states that bars larger than #11 shall not be bundled in beams\\nor girders. This is primarily because of crack control problems, a subject discussed in Chapter\\n6 of this text. That is, if the ACI crack control provisions are to be met, bars larger than\\n#11 cannot practically be used. The AASHTO permits the use of two-, three-, and four-bar\\nbundles for bars up through the #11 size. For bars larger than #11, however, AASHTO limits\\nthe bundles to two bars (AASHTO Sections 8.21.5 ASD and 5.10.3.1.5 strength design).\\nTypical conﬁgurations for two-, three-, and four-bar bundles are shown in Figure 4.6.\\nWhen bundles of more than one bar deep vertically are used in the plane of bending, they may\\nnot practically be hooked or bent as a unit. If end hooks are required, it is preferable to stagger\\nthe hooks of the individual bars within the bundle.\\nAlthough the ACI permits the use of bundled bars, their use in the tension areas of beams\\nmay very well be counterproductive b ecause of the other applicable code restrictions that are\\nbrought into play as a result of their use.\\nWhen spacing limitations and cover requirements are based on bar sizes, the bundled\\nbars may be treated as a single bar for computation purposes; the diameter of the ﬁctitious\\nbar is to be calculated from the total equivalent area of the group. When individual bars in\\na bundle are cut off within the span of beams or girders, they should terminate at different\\npoints. The code (7.6.6.4) requires that there be a stagger of at least 40 bar diameters.\\nFIGURE 4 . 6 Bundled-bar arrangements.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 118}, page_content='McCormac c04.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 8:44 P.M. Page 99\\n4.7 One-Way Slabs 99\\n4.7 One-Way Slabs\\nReinforced concrete slabs are large ﬂat plates that are supported by reinforced concrete beams,\\nwalls, or columns; by masonry walls; by structural steel beams or columns; or by the ground.\\nIf they are supported on two opposite sides only, they are referred to asone-way slabs because\\nthe bending is in one direction only—that is, perpendicular to the supported edges. Should the\\nslab be supported by beams on all four edges, it is referred to as atwo-way slab because the\\nbending is in both directions. Actually, if a rectangular slab is supported on all four sides, but\\nthe long side is two or more times as long as the short side, the slab will, for all practical\\npurposes, act as a one-way slab, with bending primarily occurring in the short direction. Such\\nslabs are designed as one-way slabs. You can easily verify these bending moment ideas by\\nsupporting a sheet of paper on two opposite sides or on four sides with the support situation\\ndescribed. This section is concerned with one-way slabs; two-way slabs are considered in\\nChapters 16 and 17. It should be realized that a large percentage of reinforced concrete slabs\\nfall into the one-way class.\\nA one-way slab is assumed to be a rectangular beam with a large ratio of width to depth.\\nNormally, a 12-in.-wide piece of such a slab is designed as a beam (see Figure 4.7), the slab\\nbeing assumed to consist of a series of such beams side by side. The method of analysis is\\nsomewhat conservative because of the lateral restraint provided by the adjacent parts of the\\nslab. Normally, a beam will tend to expand laterally somewhat as it bends, but this tendency\\nto expand by each of the 12-in. strips is resisted by the adjacent 12-in.-wide strips, which tend\\nto expand also. In other words, Poisson’s ratio is assumed to be zero. Actually, the lateral\\nexpansion tendency results in a very slight stiffening of the beam strips, which is neglected in\\nthe design procedure used here.\\nThe 12-in.-wide beam is quite convenient when thinking of the load calculations b ecause\\nloads are normally speciﬁed as so many pounds per square foot, and thus the load carried per\\nfoot of length of the 12-in.-wide beam is the load supported per square foot by the slab. The\\nload supported by the one-way slab, including its own weight, is transferred to the members\\nsupporting the edges of the slab. Obviously, the reinforcing for ﬂexure is placed perpendicular\\nto these supports—that is, parallel to the long direction of the 12-in.-wide beams. This ﬂexural\\nreinforcing may not be spaced farther on center than three times the slab thickness, or 18 in.,\\naccording to the ACI Code (7.6.5). Of course, there will be some reinforcing placed in the\\nother direction to resist shrinkage and temperature stresses.\\n12 in.\\n12 in.\\nFIGURE 4 . 7 A 12-in. strip in a simply supported one-way slab.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 119}, page_content='McCormac c04.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 8:44 P.M. Page 100\\n100 CHAPTER 4 Design of Rectangular Beams and One-Way Slabs\\nThe thickness required for a particular one-way slab depends on the bending, the deﬂec-\\ntion, and shear requirements. As described in Section 4.2, the ACI Code (9.5.2.1) provides\\ncertain span/depth limitations for concrete ﬂexural members where deﬂections are not calcu-\\nlated.\\nBecause of the quan tities of concrete involved in ﬂoor slabs, their depths are rounded\\noff to closer values than are used for beam depths. Slab thicknesses are usually rounded off to\\nthe nearest1\\n4 in. on the high side for slabs of 6 in. or less in thickness and to the nearest 1\\n2 in.\\non the high side for slabs thicker than 6 in.\\nAs concrete hardens, it shrinks. In addition, temperature changes occur that cause expan-\\nsion and contraction of the concrete. When cooling occurs, the shrinkage effect and the\\nshortening due to cooling add together. The code (7.12) states that shrinkage and tempera-\\nture reinforcement must be provided in a direction perpendicular to the main reinforcement for\\none-way slabs. (For two-way slabs, reinforcement is provided in both directions for bending.)\\nThe code states that for Grade 40 or 50 deformed bars, the minimum percentage of this steel is\\n0.002 times the gross cross-sectional area of the slab. Notice that the gross cross-sectional area\\nis bh (where h is the slab thickness). The code (7.12.2.2) states that shrinkage and temperature\\nreinforcement may not be spaced farther apart than ﬁve times the slab thickness, or 18 in.\\nWhen Grade 60 deformed bars or welded wire fabric is used, the minimum area is 0.0018bh.\\nFor slabs with fy >60,000 psi, the minimum value is (0.0018 × 60,000)/fy ≥ 0.0014.\\nIn SI units, the minimum percentages of reinforcing are 0.002 for Grades 300 and 350\\nsteels and 0.0018 for Grade 420 steel. When fy >420 MPa, the minimum percentage equals\\n(0.0018 × 420)/fy. The reinforcing may not be spaced farther apart than ﬁve times the\\nslab thickness, or 500 mm.\\nShould structural walls or large columns provide appreciable resistance to shrinkage and\\ntemperature movements, it may very well be necessary to increase the minimum amounts listed.\\nShrinkage and temperature steel serves as mat steel in that it is tied perpendicular to\\nthe main ﬂexural reinforcing and holds it ﬁrmly in place as a mat. This steel also helps to\\ndistribute concentrated loads transversely in the slab. (In a similar manner, the AASHTO gives\\nminimum permissible amounts of reinforcing in slabs transverse to the main ﬂexural reinforcing\\nfor lateral distribution of wheel loads.)\\nAreas of steel are often determined for 1-ft widths of reinforced concrete slabs, footings,\\nand walls. A table of areas of bars in slabs such as Appendix A, Table A.6 is very useful in\\nsuch cases for selecting the speciﬁc bars to be used. A brief explanation of the preparation of\\nthis table is provided here.\\nFor a 1 ft width of concrete, the total steel area obviously equals the total or average\\nnumber of bars in a 1-ft width times the cross-sectional area of one bar. This can be expressed\\nas (12 in./bar spacing c. to c.)(area of 1 bar). Some examples follow, and the values obtained\\ncan be checked in the table. Understanding these calculations enables one to expand the table\\nas desired.\\n1. #9 bars, 6-in. o.c. total area in 1-ft width = (12\\n6\\n⎡(1.00) = 2.00 in.2\\n2. #9 bars, 5-in. o.c. total area in 1-ft width = (12\\n5\\n⎡(1.00) = 2.40 in.2\\nExample 4.6 illustrates the design of a one-way slab.

Page 102\\n102 CHAPTER 4 Design of Rectangular Beams and One-Way Slabs\\nThe designers of reinforced concrete structures must be very careful to comply with\\nbuilding code requirements for ﬁre resistance. If the applicable code requires a certain ﬁre\\nresistance rating for ﬂoor systems, that requirement may very well cause the designer to use\\nthicker slabs than might otherwise be required to meet the ACI strength design requirements.\\nIn other words, the designer of a building should study carefully the ﬁre resistance provisions\\nof the governing building code before proceeding with the design. Section 7.7.8 of ACI 318-11\\nincludes such a requirement.\\n4.8 Cantilever Beams and Continuous Beams\\nCantilever beams supporting gravity loads are subject to negative moments throughout their\\nlengths. As a result, their reinforcement is placed in their top or tensile sides, as shown in\\nFigures 4.9 and 4.10(a). The reader will note that for such members the maximum moments\\noccur at the faces of the ﬁxed s upports. As a result, the largest amounts of reinforcing are\\nrequired at those points. You should also note that the bars cannot be stopped at the support\\nfaces. They must be extended or anchored in the concrete be yond the support f ace. We will\\nlater call this development length. The development length does not have to be straight as\\nshown in the ﬁgure, because the bars may be hooked at 90◦ or 180◦. Development lengths and\\nhooked bars are discussed in depth in Chapter 7.\\nUp to this point, only statically determinate members have been considered. The very com-\\nmon situation, however, is for beams and slabs to be continuous over several supports, as shown\\nin Figure 4.10. Because reinforcing is needed on the tensile sides of the beams, we will place it\\nin the bottoms when we have positive moments and in the tops when we have negative moments.\\nThere are several ways in which the reinforcing bars can be arranged to resist the positive and\\nnegative moments in continuous members. One possible arrangement is shown in Figure 4.10(a).\\nThese members, including bar arrangements, are discussed in detail in Chapter 14.\\nFIGURE 4 . 9 Cantilever beam\\ndevelopment length.\\nNote: Some of +As\\ncontinues into supports.\\n+As\\n+\\n−−\\n+\\n−−\\n+\\n−−\\n(a)\\n(b)\\n−As\\nFIGURE 4 . 1 0 Continuous slab showing theoretical placement of bars for given moment\\ndiagram.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 122}, page_content='McCormac c04.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 8:44 P.M.

Page 112\\nCHAPTER 5\\n Analysis and Design of T Beams\\nand Doubly Reinforced Beams\\n5.1 T Beams\\nReinforced concrete ﬂoor systems normally consist of slabs and beams that are placed m ono-\\nlithically. As a result, the two parts act together to resist loads. In effect, the beams have extra\\nwidths at their tops, calledﬂanges, and the resulting T-shaped beams are called Tb e a m s.T h e\\npart of a T beam below the slab is referred to as the web or stem. (The beams may be L shaped\\nif the stem is at the end of a slab.) The stirrups (described in Chapter 8) in the webs extend\\nup into the slabs, as perhaps do bent-up bars, with the result that they further make the beams\\nand slabs act together.\\nThere is a problem involved in estimating how much of the slab acts as part of the beam.\\nShould the ﬂanges of a T beam be rather stocky and compact in cross section, bending stresses\\nwill be fairly uniformly distributed across the compression zone. If, however, the ﬂanges are\\nwide and thin, bending stresses will vary quite a bit across the ﬂange due to shear deformations.\\nThe farther a particular part of the slab or ﬂange is away from the stem, the smaller will be\\nits bending stress.\\nInstead of considering a varying stress distribution across the full width of the ﬂange,\\nthe ACI Code (8.12.2) calls for a smaller width with an assumed uniform stress distribution\\nfor design purposes. The objective is to have the same total compression force in the reduced\\nwidth that actually occurs in the full width with its varying stresses.\\nThe hatched area in Figure 5.1 shows the effective size of a T beam. For T beams with\\nﬂanges on both sides of the web, the code states that the effective ﬂange width may not exceed\\none-fourth of the beam span, and the overhanging width on each side may not exceed eight\\ntimes the slab thickness or one-half the clear distance to the next web. An isolated T beam\\nmust have a ﬂange thickness no less than one-half the web width, and its effective ﬂange width\\nmay not be larger than four times the web width (ACI 8.12.4). If there is a ﬂange on only one\\nside of the web, the width of the overhanging ﬂange cannot exceed one-twelfth the span, 6 hf ,\\nor half the clear distance to the next web (ACI 8.12.3).\\nThe analysis of T beams is quite similar to the analysis of rectangular beams in that\\nthe speciﬁcations relating to the strains in the reinforcing are identical. To repeat brieﬂy, it is\\ndesirable to haveϵt values ≥ 0.005, and they may not be less than 0.004 unless the member\\nis subjected to an axial load ≥ 0.10f ′\\nc Ag. You will learn that ϵt values are almost always\\nmuch larger than 0.005 in T beams because of their very large compression ﬂanges. For such\\nmembers, the values ofc are normally very small, and calculated ϵt values very large.\\nThe neutral axis (N.A.) for T beams can fall either in the ﬂange or in the stem, depending\\non the proportions of the slabs and stems. If it falls in the ﬂange, and it almost always does\\nfor positive moments, the rectangular beam formulas apply, as can be seen in Figure 5.2(a).\\nThe concrete below the neutral axis is assumed to be cracked, and its shape has no effect on\\nthe ﬂexure calculations (other than weight). The section above the neutral axis is rectangular.\\nIf the neutral axis is below the ﬂange, however, as shown for the beam of Figure 5.2(b), the\\ncompression concrete above the neutral axis no longer consists of a single rectangle, and thus\\nthe normal rectangular beam expressions do not apply.\\n112'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 132}, page_content='McCormac c05.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 11:07 P.M.

If the computed value of a is equal to\\nor less than the ﬂange thickness, the section for all practical purposes can be assumed to be\\nrectangular, even though the computed value of c is actually greater than the ﬂange thickness.\\nA beam does not really have to look like a T beam to be one. This fact is shown by the\\nbeam cross sections shown in Figure 5.3. For these cases the compression concrete is T shaped,\\nand the shape or size of the concrete on the tension side, which is assumed to be cracked, has\\nno effect on the theoretical resisting moments. It is true, however, that the shapes, sizes, and\\nweights of the tensile concrete do affect the deﬂections that occur (as is described in Chapter\\n6), and their dead weights affect the magnitudes of the moments to be resisted.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 133}, page_content='McCormac c05.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 11:07 P.M.

It is a general method that is applicable to tensilely reinforced beams of any cross\\nsection, including T beams. T beams are so very common, however, that many designers\\nprefer another method that is speciﬁcally designed for T beams.\\nFirst, the value of a is determined as previously described in this chapter. Should it be\\nless than the ﬂange thickness, hf , we will have a rectangular beam and the rectangular beam\\nformulas will apply. Should it be greater than the ﬂange thickness, hf (as was the case for\\nExample 5.2), the special method to be described here will be very useful.\\nThe beam is divided into a set of rectangular parts consisting of the overhanging parts\\nof the ﬂange and the compression part of the web (see Figure 5.7).\\nThe total compression, Cw , in the web rectangle, and the total compression in the over-\\nhanging ﬂange, Cf , are computed:\\nCw = 0.85f ′\\nc abw\\nCf = 0.85f ′\\nc (b − bw )(hf )\\nThen the nominal moment, Mn , is determined by multiplying Cw and Cf by their respec-\\ntive lever arms from their centroids to the centroid of the steel:\\nMn = Cw\\n(\\nd − a\\n2\\n⎡\\n+ Cf\\n(\\nd −\\nhf\\n2\\n⎡\\nThis procedure is illustrated in Example 5.3. Although it seems to offer little advantage\\nin computing Mn , we will learn that it does simplify the design of T beams when a > hf\\nbecause it permits a direct solution of an otherwise trial-and-error problem.\\nFIGURE 5 . 7 Separation of T beam into rectangular parts.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 138}, page_content='McCormac c05.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 11:07 P.M.

Page 120\\n120 CHAPTER 5 Analysis and Design of T Beams and Doubly Reinforced Beams\\n5.4 Design of T Beams\\nFor the design of T beams, the ﬂange has normally already been selected in the slab design, as it\\nis for the slab. The size of the web is normally not selected on the basis of moment requirements\\nbut probably is given an area based on shear requirements; that is, a sufﬁcient area is used so as\\nto provide a certain minimum shear capacity, as will be described in Chapter 8. It is also possible\\nthat the width of the web may be selected on the basis of the width estimated to be needed to put in\\nthe reinforcing bars. Sizes may also have been preselected, as previously described in Section 4.5,\\nto simplify formwork for architectural requirements or for deﬂection reasons. For the examples\\nthat follow (5.4 and 5.5), the values ofhf , d, and bw are given.\\nThe ﬂanges of most T beams are usually so large that the neutral axis probably falls\\nwithin the ﬂange, and thus the rectangular beam formulas apply. Should the neutral axis fall\\nwithin the web, a trial-and-error process is often used for the design. In this process, a lever\\narm from the center of gravity of the compression block to the center of gravity of the steel is\\nestimated to equal the larger of 0.9d or d − (hf /2), and from this value, called z, a trial steel\\narea is calculated (As = Mn /fy z). Then by the process used in Example 5.2, the value of the\\nestimated lever arm is checked. If there is much difference, the estimated value of z is revised\\nand a new As determined. This process is continued until the change in As is quite small.\\nT beams are designed in Examples 5.4 and 5.5 by this process.\\nOften a T beam is part of a continuous beam that spans over interior supports, such as\\ncolumns. The bending moment over the support is negative, so the ﬂange is in tension. Also,\\nthe magnitude of the negative moment is usually larger than that of the positive moment near\\nmidspan. This situation will control the design of the T beam because the depth and web width\\nwill be determined for this case. Then, when the beam is designed for positive moment at\\nmidspan, the width and depth are already known. See Section 5.5 for other details on T beams\\nwith negative moments.\\nExample 5.6 presents a more direct approach for the case where a > hf .T h i si st h ec a s e\\nwhere the beam is assumed to be divided into its rectangular parts.\\nExample 5.4\\nDesign a T beam for the ﬂoor system shown in Figure 5.9, for which bw and d are given.\\nMD = 80 ft-k, ML = 100 ft-k, f′\\nc = 4000 psi, fy = 60,000 psi, and simple span= 20 ft.\\nSOLUTION\\nEffective Flange Width\\n(a) 1\\n4 ft × 20 ft= 5f t= 60 in.\\n(b) 12 in. + (2) (8) (4 in.)= 76 in.\\n(c) 10 ft= 120 in.\\n10 ft 0 in. 10 ft 0 in. 10 ft 0 in. 10 ft 0 in.\\nd = 18 in.\\nhf = 4 in.\\nbw  = 12 in.\\nFIGURE 5 . 9 Cross section of T-beam ﬂoor system for Example 5.4.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 140}, page_content='McCormac c05.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 11:07 P.M.

For this\\ndiscussion, reference is made to Figure 5.7.\\nThe compression force provided by the overhanging ﬂange rectangles must be balanced\\nby the tensile force in part of the tensile steel, Asf , while the compression force in the web is\\nbalanced by the tensile force in the remaining tensile steel, Asw .\\nFor the overhanging ﬂange, we have\\n0.85f ′\\nc (b − bw )(hf ) = Asf fy\\nfrom which the required area of steel, Asf , equals\\nAsf =\\n0.85f ′\\nc (b − bw )hf\\nfy\\nThe design strength of these overhanging ﬂanges is\\nMuf = φAsf fy\\n(\\nd −\\nhf\\n2\\n⎡\\nThe remaining moment to be resisted by the web of the T beam and the steel required\\nto balance that value are determined next.\\nMuw = Mu − Muf\\nThe steel required to balance the moment in the rectangular web is obtained by the usual\\nrectangular beam expression.

Obviously, for such situations,\\nthe rectangular beam design formulas will be used. Section 10.6.6 of the ACI Code requires that\\npart of the ﬂexural steel in the top of the beam in the negative-moment region be distributed\\nover the effective width of the ﬂange or over a width equal to one-tenth of the beam span,\\nwhichever is smaller. Should the effective width be greater than one-tenth of the span length,\\nthe code requires that some additional longitudinal steel be placed in the outer portions of the\\nﬂange. The intention of this part of the code is to minimize the sizes of the ﬂexural cracks\\nthat will occur in the top surface of the ﬂange perpendicular to the stem of a T beam subject\\nto negative moments.\\nIn Section 3.8, it was stated that if a rectangular section had a very small amount of\\ntensile reinforcing, its design-resisting moment, φMn , might very well be less than its cracking\\nmoment. If this were the case, the beam might fail without warning when the ﬁrst crack\\noccurred. The same situation applies to T beams with a very small amount of tensile reinforcing.\\nWhen the ﬂange of a T beam is in tension, the amount of tensile reinforcing needed\\nto make its ultimate resisting moment equal to its cracking moment is about twice that of\\na rectangular section or that of a T section with its ﬂange in compression. As a result, ACI\\nFIGURE 5 . 1 2 T beam with ﬂange in tension\\nand bottom (hatched) in compression\\n(a rectangular beam).'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 145}, page_content='McCormac c05.tex V2 - January 10, 2013 9:26 P.M.

Thus they will bend about their horizontal axes and\\nwill be handled as symmetrical sections, exactly as with T beams.\\nFor L beams, the effective width of the overhanging ﬂange may not be larger than one-\\ntwelfth the span length of the beam, six times the slab thickness, or one-half the clear distance\\nto the next web (ACI 8.12.3).\\nIf an L beam is assumed to be free to deﬂect both vertically and horizontally, it will be\\nnecessary to analyze it as an unsymmetrical section with bending about both the horizontal\\nand vertical axes. An excellent reference on this topic is given in a book by MacGregor. 1\\n5.7 Compression Steel\\nThe steel that is occasionally used on the compression sides of beams is called compression\\nsteel, and beams with both tensile and compressive steel are referred to as doubly reinforced\\nbeams. Compression steel is not normally required in sections designed by the strength method\\nbecause use of the full compressive strength of the concrete decidedly decreases the need for\\nsuch reinforcement, as compared to designs made with the working-stress design method.\\nOccasionally, however, space or aesthetic requirements limit beams to such small sizes\\nthat compression steel is needed in addition to tensile steel. To increase the moment capacity\\nof a beam beyond that of a tensilely reinforced beam with the maximum percentage of steel\\n[when (ϵt = 0.005)], it is necessary to introduce another resisting couple in the beam. This is\\ndone by adding steel in both the compression and tensile sides of the beam. Compressive steel\\nincreases not only the resisting moments of concrete sections but also the amount of curvature\\nthat a member can take before ﬂexural failure. This means that the ductility of such sections\\nwill be appreciably increased. Though expensive, compression steel makes beams tough and\\nductile, enabling them to withstand large moments, deformations, and stress reversals such as\\nmight occur during earthquakes. As a result, many building codes for earthquake zones require\\nthat certain minimum amounts of compression steel be included in ﬂexural members.\\nCompression steel is very effective in reducing long-term deﬂections due to shrinkage\\nand plastic ﬂow. In this regard you should note the effect of compression steel on the long-term\\ndeﬂection expression in Section 9.5.2.5 of the code (to be discussed in Chapter 6 of this text).\\nContinuous compression bars are also helpful for positioning stirrups (by tying them to the\\ncompression bars) and keeping them in place during concrete placement and vibration.\\n1 Wight, J. K. and MacGregor, J. G., 2011, Reinforced Concrete Mechanics and Design , 6th ed.

Page 128\\n128 CHAPTER 5 Analysis and Design of T Beams and Doubly Reinforced Beams\\nTests of doubly reinforced concrete beams have shown that even if the compression\\nconcrete crushes, the beam may very well not collapse if the compression steel is enclosed by\\nstirrups. Once the compression concrete reaches its crushing strain, the concrete cover spalls\\nor splits off the bars, much as in columns (see Chapter 9). If the compression bars are conﬁned\\nby closely spaced stirrups, the bars will not buckle until add itional moment is applied. This\\nadditional moment cannot be considered in practice b ecause beams are not practically useful\\nafter part of their concrete breaks off. (Would you like to use a building after some parts of\\nthe concrete beams have fallen on the ﬂoor?)\\nSection 7.11.1 of the ACI Code states that compression steel in beams must be enclosed\\nby ties or stirrups or by welded wire fabric of equivalent area. In Section 7.10.5.1, the code\\nstates that the ties must be at least #3 in size for longitudinal bars #10 and smaller and at\\nleast #4 for larger longitudinal bars and bundled longitudinal bars. The ties may not be spaced\\nfarther apart than 16 bar diameters, 48 tie diameters, or the least dimension of the beam cross\\nsection (code 7.10.5.2).\\nFor doubly reinforced beams, an initial assumption is made that the compression steel\\nyields as well as the tensile steel. (The tensile steel is always assumed to yield because of the\\nductile requirements of the ACI Code.) If the strain at the extreme ﬁber of the compression\\nconcrete is assumed to equal 0.00300 and the compression steel, A′\\ns , is located two-thirds of the\\ndistance from the neutral axis to the extreme concrete ﬁber, then the strain in the compression\\nsteel equals2\\n3 × 0.003 = 0.002. If this is greater than the strain in the steel at yield, as say\\n50,000/(29 × 106) = 0.00172 for 50,000-psi steel, the steel has yielded. It should be noted that\\nactually the creep and shrinkage occurring in the compression concrete help the compression\\nsteel to yield.\\nSometimes the neutral axis is quite close to the compression steel. As a matter of fact,\\nin some beams with low steel percentages, the neutral axis may be right at the compression\\nsteel. For such cases, the addition of compression steel adds little, if any, moment capacity to\\nthe beam. It can, however, make the beam more ductile.\\nWhen compression steel is used, the nominal resisting moment of the beam is assumed to\\nconsist of two parts: the part due to the resistance of the compression concrete and the balancing\\ntensile reinforcing, and the part due to the nominal moment capacity of the compression\\nsteel and the balancing amount of the additional tensile steel. This situation is illustrated in\\nFigure 5.13. In the expressions developed here, the effect of the concrete in compression,\\nwhich is replaced by the compressive steel, A′\\ns , is neglected. This omission will cause us to\\noverestimate Mn by a very small and negligible amount (less than 1%). The ﬁrst of the two\\nresisting moments is illustrated in Figure 5.13(b).\\nMn1 = As1 fy\\n(\\nd − a\\n2\\n⎡\\nMn1 = As1 fy(d – )\\na—2Mn = Mn1 + Mn2 Mn2 = As'fs' (d – d') = As2 fy (d – d')\\nFIGURE 5 . 1 3 Doubly reinforced beam broken into parts.\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 148}, page_content='McCormac c05.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 11:07 P.M. Page 129\\n5.7 Compression Steel 129\\nThe second resisting moment is that produced by the additional tensile and compressive\\nsteel (As2 and A′\\ns ), which is presented in Figure 5.13(c).\\nMn2 = A′\\ns fy (d − d′)\\nUp to this point it has been assumed that the compression steel has reached its yield\\nstress. If such is the case, the values of As2 and A′\\ns will be equal because the add ition to T of\\nAs2fy must be equal to the addition to C of A′\\ns fy for equilibrium. If the compression steel has\\nnot yielded, A′\\ns must be larger than As2, as will be described later in this section.\\nCombining the two values, we obtain\\nMn = As1fy\\n(\\nd − a\\n2\\n⎡\\n+ As2fy(d − d′)\\nφMn = φ\\n[\\nAs1fy\\n(\\nd − a\\n2\\n⎡\\n+ As2fy (d − d′)\\n]\\nThe addition of compression steel only on the compression side of a beam will have\\nlittle effect on the nominal resisting moment of the section. The lever arm, z, of the internal\\ncouple is not affected very much by the presence of the compression steel, and the value of T\\nwill remain the same. Thus, the value Mn = Tz will change very little. To increase the nominal\\nresisting moment of a section, it is necessary to add reinforcing on both the tension and the\\ncompression sides of the beam, thus providing another resisting moment couple.\\nExamples 5.7 and 5.8 illustrate the calculations involved in determining the design\\nstrengths of doubly reinforced sections. In each of these problems, the strain, f ′\\ns ,i nt h ec o m -\\npression steel is checked to determine whether or not it has yielded. With the strain obtained,\\nthe compression steel stress,f ′\\ns , is determined, and the value of As2 is computed with the\\nfollowing expression:\\nAs2fy = A′\\ns f ′\\ns\\nIn addition, it is necessary to compute the strain in the tensile steel, ϵt , because if it is\\nless than 0.005, the value of the bending, φ, will have to be computed, inasmuch as it will be\\nless than its usual 0.90 value. The beam may not be used in the unlikely event that ϵt is less\\nthan 0.004.\\nTo determine the value of these strains, an equilibrium equation is written, which upon\\nsolution will yield the value of c and thus the location of the neutral axis. To write this equation,\\nthe nominal tensile strength of the beam is equated to its nominal compressive strength. Only\\none unknown appears in the equation, and that is c.\\nInitially the stress in the compression steel is assumed to be at yield (f ′\\ns = fy ).F r o m\\nFigure 5.14, summing forces horizontally in the force diagram and substitutingβ1c for a leads to\\nAs fy = 0.85f ′\\nc β1cb + A′\\ns fy\\nc =\\n(As − A′\\ns )fy\\n0.85f ′c β1b\\nReferring to the strain diagram of Figure 5.14, from similar triangles\\nϵ′\\ns = c − d′\\nc (0.003)\\nIf the strain in the compression steel ϵ′\\ns >ϵ y = fy/Es , the assumption is valid and f ′\\ns is at\\nyield, fy.I f ϵ′\\ns <ϵ y , the compression steel is not yielding, and the value of c calculated above\\nis not correct.

The term\\nlimit state is used to describe a condition at which a structure or some part of a structure\\nceases to perform its intended function. There are two categories of limit states: strength and\\nserviceability.\\nStrength limit states are based on the safety or load-carrying capacity of structures and\\ninclude buckling, fracture, fatigue, overturning, and so on. Chapters 3 to 5 have been concerned\\nwith the bending limit state of various members.\\nServiceability limit states refer to the performance of structures under normal service loads\\nand are concerned with the uses and/or occupancy of structures. Serviceab ility is measured\\nby considering the magnitudes of deﬂections, cracks, and vibrations of structures, as well\\nas by considering the amounts of surface deterioration of the concrete and corrosion of the\\nreinforcing. You will note that these items may disrupt the use of structures but do not usually\\ninvolve collapse.\\nThis chapter is concerned with serviceab ility limits for deﬂections and crack widths. The\\nACI Code contains very speciﬁc requirements relating to the strength limit states of reinforced\\nconcrete members but allows the designer some freedom of judgment in the serviceability\\nareas. This doesn’t mean that the serviceab ility limit states are not signiﬁcant, but by far the\\nmost important consideration (as in all structural speciﬁcations) is the life and property of the\\npublic. As a result, public safety is not left up to the judgment of the individual designer.\\nV ertical vibration for bridge and building ﬂoors, as well as lateral and torsional vibration\\nin tall buildings, can be quite annoying to users of these structures. Vibrations are not usually\\na problem in the average-size reinforced concrete building, but we should be on the lookout\\nfor the situations where they can be objectionable.\\nThe deterioration of concrete surfaces can be greatly minimized by exercising good\\ncontrol of the mixing, placing, and curing of the concrete. When those surfaces are subjected\\nto harsh chemicals, special cements with special additives can be used to protect the surfaces.\\nThe corrosion of reinforcing can be greatly minimized by giving careful attention to concrete\\nquality, using good vibration of the concrete, using adequate cover thickness for the bars, and\\nlimiting crack sizes.\\n6.2 Importance of Deﬂections\\nThe adoption of the strength design method, together with the use of higher-strength concretes\\nand steels, has permitted the use of relatively slender members. As a result, deﬂections and\\ndeﬂection cracking have become more severe problems than they were a few decades ago.\\nThe magnitudes of deﬂections for concrete members can be quite important. Excessive\\ndeﬂections of beams and slabs may cause sagging ﬂoors, ponding on ﬂat roofs, excessive\\nvibrations, and even interference with the proper operation of supported machinery.

In addition,\\nthey may damage a structure’s appearance or frighten the occupants of the building, even\\nthough the building may be perfectly safe. Any structure used by people should be quite rigid\\nand relatively vibration-free so as to provide a sense of security.\\nPerhaps the most common type of deﬂection damage in reinforced concrete structures\\nis the damage to light masonry partitions. They are particularly subject to damage b ecause\\nof concrete’s long-term creep. When the ﬂoors above and below deﬂect, the relatively rigid\\nmasonry partitions do not bend easily and are often severely damaged. The more ﬂexible\\ngypsum board partitions are much more adaptable to such distortions.\\n6.3 Control of Deﬂections\\nOne of the best ways to reduce deﬂections is by increasing member depths—but designers are\\nalways under pressure to keep members as shallow as possible. (As you can see, shallower\\nmembers mean thinner ﬂoors, and thinner ﬂoors mean buildings with less height, with con-\\nsequent reductions in many costs, such as plumbing, wiring, elevators, outside materials on\\nbuildings, and so on.) Reinforced concrete speciﬁcations usually limit deﬂections by specifying\\ncertain minimum depths or maximum permissible computed deﬂections.\\nMinimum Thicknesses\\nTable 4.1 in Chapter 4, which is Table 9.5(a) of the ACI Code, provides a set of minimum\\nthicknesses for beams and one-way slabs to be used, unless actual deﬂection calculations\\nindicate that lesser thicknesses are permissibl e. These minimum thickness values, which were\\ndeveloped primarily on the basis of experience over many years, should be used only for\\nbeams and slabs that are not supporting or attached to partitions or other members likely to be\\ndamaged by deﬂections.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 175}, page_content='McCormac c06.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:03 P.M.

If this is done, the values determined may not ex ceed the values\\nspeciﬁed in Table 6.1, which is Table 9.5(b) of the ACI Code.\\nCamber\\nThe deﬂection of reinforced concrete members may also be controlled by cambering. The\\nmembers are constructed of such a shape that they will assume their theoretical shape under\\nsome service loading condition (usually dead load and perhaps some part of the live load). A\\nsimple beam would be constructed with a slight convex bend, so that under certain gravity loads,\\nit would become straight, as assumed in the calculations. (See Figure 6.1.) Some designers\\ntake into account both dead and full live loads in ﬁguring the amount of camber.

Page 157\\n6.4 Calculation of Deﬂections 157\\n6.4 Calculation of Deﬂections\\nDeﬂections for reinforced concrete members can be calculated with the usual deﬂection expres-\\nsions, several of which are shown in Figure 6.2. A few comments should be made about the\\nmagnitudes of deﬂections in concrete members as determined by the expressions given in\\nthis ﬁgure. It can be seen that the centerline deﬂection of a uniformly loaded simple beam\\n[Figure 6.2(a)] is ﬁve times as large as the centerline deﬂection of the same beam if its\\nends are ﬁxed [Figure 6.2(b)]. Nearly all concrete beams and slabs are continuous, and their\\ndeﬂections fall somewhere between the two extremes mentioned here.\\nBecause of the very large deﬂection variations that occur with different end restraints, it\\nis essential that those restraints be considered if realistic deﬂection calculations are to be made.\\nFor most practical purposes, it is sufﬁciently accurate to calculate the centerline deﬂection of a\\nmember as though it is simply supported and to subtract from that value the deﬂection caused\\nby the average of the negative moments at the member ends. (This can be done by using a\\ncombination of expressions taken from Figure 6.2. For instance, the deﬂection equation of part\\n(a) may be used together with the one of part (g) applied at one or both ends as necessary.)\\nLoads used in these expressions are unfactored loads. In some cases, only the live load is\\nconsidered; in others, both live and dead (sustained) loads are considered.\\nw k/ft\\n(a)\\n(b)\\n(d)\\n(c)\\nP\\nw k/ft\\nw k/ft\\n`\\n`\\n`\\n`\\n2\\n`\\n2\\nδCL\\nδfree end\\nδCL\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n5w`4\\n384EI\\nw`4\\n384EI\\nδCL\\n= P`3\\n48EI\\nw`4\\n8EI\\nFIGURE 6 . 2 Some deﬂection expressions.\\n(continues )'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 177}, page_content='McCormac c06.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:03 P.M.

The trouble lies in the amount of cracking that has occurred.\\nIf the bending moment is less than the cracking moment (i.e., if the ﬂexural stress is less than\\nthe modulus of rupture of about 7.5 λ√\\nf ′c ), the full uncracked section provides rigidity, and\\nthe moment of inertia for the gross section Ig is available. When larger moments are present,\\ndifferent-size tension cracks occur and the position of the neutral axis varies.\\nFigure 6.3 illustrates the problem involved in selecting the moment of inertia to be used\\nfor deﬂection calculations. Although a reinforced concrete beam may be of constant size (or\\nprismatic) throughout its length, for deﬂection calculations, it will behave as though it were\\ncomposed of segments of different-size beams. 1\\nFor the portion of a beam where the moment is less than the cracking moment, Mcr,t h e\\nbeam can be assumed to be uncracked, and the moment of inertia can be assumed to equal Ig.\\nWhen the moment is greater than Mcr, the tensile cracks that develop in the beam will, in\\neffect, cause the beam cross section to be reduced, and the moment of inertia may be assumed\\nto equal the transformed value, Icr. It is as though the beam consists of the segments shown\\nin Figure 6.3(d).\\nThe problem is even more involved than indicated by Figure 6.3. It is true that at cross\\nsections where tension cracks are actually located, the moment of inertia is probably close to\\nthe transformed Icr, but in between cracks, it is perhaps closer to Ig. Furthermore, diagonal\\ntension cracks may exist in areas of high shear, causing other variations. As a result, it is\\ndifﬁcult to decide what value of I should be used.\\n1 Leet, K., 1997, Reinforced Concrete Design, 3rd ed.

At different sections along\\nthe beam, the rigidity varies depending on the moment present. It is easy to see that an accurate\\nmethod of calculating deﬂections must take these variations into account.\\nIf it is desired to obtain the immediate deﬂection of an uncracked prismatic member, the\\nmoment of inertia may be assumed to equal Ig along the length of the member. Should\\nthe member be cracked at one or more sections along its length, or if its depth varies along\\nthe span, a more exact value ofI needs to be used.\\nSection 9.5.2.3 of the code gives a moment of inertia expression that is to be used for\\ndeﬂection calculations. This moment of inertia provides a transitional value between Ig and Icr\\nthat depends upon the extent of cracking caused by applied loads. It is referred to as Ie,t h e\\neffective moment of inertia, and is based on an estimation of the probable amount of cracking\\ncaused by the varying moment throughout the span 2:\\nIe =\\n(Mcr\\nMa\\n⎡3\\n(Ig ) +\\n[\\n1 −\\n(Mcr\\nMa\\n⎡3]\\nIcr (ACI Equation 9-8)\\n2 Branson, D.

Page 160\\n160 CHAPTER 6 Serviceability\\nIn this expression, Ig is the gross amount of inertia (without considering the steel) of the\\nsection and Mcr is the cracking moment = fr Ig/yt, with fr = 7.5λ√\\nf ′c .[3] Ma is the maximum\\nservice-load moment occurring for the condition under consideration, and Icr is the transformed\\nmoment of inertia of the cracked section, as described in Section 2.3.\\nYou will note that the values of the effective moment of inertia vary with different loading\\nconditions. This is because the service-load moment, Ma, used in the equation for Ie, is differ-\\nent for each loading c ondition. Some designers ignore this fact and use only one Ie for each\\nmember, even though different loading conditions are considered. They feel that their com-\\nputed values are just as accurate as those obtained with the differentIe values. It is true that\\nthe varying conditions involved in constructing reinforced concrete members (workmanship,\\ncuring conditions, age of members when loads were ﬁrst applied, etc.) make the calculation of\\ndeﬂections by any present-day procedure a very approximate process.\\nIn this chapter the authors compute Ie for each different loading c ondition. The work is\\na little tedious, but it can be greatly expedited with various tables, such as the ones provided\\nin the ACI Design Handbook.4\\n6.6 Long-Term Deﬂections\\nWith Ie and the appropriate deﬂection expressions, instantaneous or immediate deﬂections are\\nobtained. Long-term or sustained loads, however, cause signiﬁcant increases in these deﬂections\\nbecause of shrinkage and creep. The factors affecting deﬂection increases include humidity,\\ntemperature, curing conditions, compression steel content, ratio of stress to strength, and the\\nage of the concrete at the time of loading.\\nIf concrete is loaded at an early age, its long-term deﬂections will be greatly increased.\\nExcessive deﬂections in reinforced concrete structures can very often be traced to the early\\napplication of loads. The creep strain after about ﬁve years (after which creep is negligible)\\nmay be as high as four or ﬁve times the initial strain when loads were ﬁrst applied 7 to 10\\ndays after the concrete was placed, while the ratio may only be two or three when the loads\\nwere ﬁrst applied 3 or 4 months after concrete placement.\\nBecause of the several factors mentioned in the last two paragraphs, the magnitudes\\nof long-term deﬂections can only be estimated. The code (9.5.2.5) states that to estimate the\\nincrease in deﬂection due to these causes, the part of the instantaneous deﬂection that is due\\nto sustained loads may be multiplied by the empirically derived factorλ at the end of this\\nparagraph and the result added to the instantaneous deﬂection. 5\\nλ/Delta1= ξ\\n1 + 50ρ′ (ACI Equation 9-11)\\nIn this expression, which is applicable to both normal- and lightweight concrete, ξ is a\\ntime-dependent factor that may be determined from Table 6.2.\\nShould times differing from the values given in Table 6.2 be used, values of ξ may be\\nselected from the curve of Figure 6.4.\\nThe effect of compression steel on long-term deﬂections is taken into account in the λ\\nexpression with the term ρ′. It equals A′\\ns /bd and is to be computed at midspan for simple and\\ncontinuous spans, and at the supports for cantilevers.\\nThe full dead load of a structure can be classiﬁed as a sustained load, but the type of\\noccupancy will determine the percentage of live load that can be called sustained.

Despite the use of plans and speciﬁcations and ﬁeld inspection, it is difﬁ-\\ncult to control ﬁeldwork adequately. Construction crews may add a little water to the concrete\\nto make it more workable. Further, they may not obtain satisfactory mixing and compaction\\nof the concrete, with the result that voids and honeycomb occur. Finally, the forms may be\\nremoved before the concrete has obtained its full design strength. If this is the case, the moduli\\nof rupture and elasticity will be low, and excessive cracks may occur in beams that would\\nnot have occurred if the concrete had been stronger. All of these factors can cause reinforced\\nconcrete structures to deﬂect appreciably more than is indicated by the usual computations.\\nIt is logical to assume that the live load cannot act on a structure when the dead load is\\nnot present. As a result of this fact, we will compute an effective Ie and a deﬂection δD for the\\ncase where the dead load alone is acting. Then we will compute an Ie and a deﬂection δD+L\\nfor the case where both dead and live loads are acting. This will enable us to determine the\\ninitial live load part of the deﬂection as follows:\\nδL = δD+L − δD\\nDuration of load, months\\n0\\n0\\n0.5\\n1.0\\n1.5\\n2.0\\nξ\\n13 6 1 2 1 8 2 4 3 0 3 6 4 8 6 0\\nFIGURE 6 . 4 Multipliers for l ong-time\\ndeﬂections.

As shown in Figure 6.6, the effective moment of inertia used for calculating\\ndeﬂections varies a great deal throughout the member. For instance, at the center of the span\\nat Section 1–1 where the positive moment is largest, the web is cracked and the effective\\nsection consists of the hatched section plus the tensile reinforcing in the bottom of the web. At\\nSection 2–2 in the ﬁgure, where the largest negative moment occurs, the ﬂange is cracked and\\nthe effective section consists of the hatched part of the web (including any compression steel\\nin the bottom of the web) plus the tensile bars in the top. Finally, near the points of inﬂection,\\nthe moment will be so low that the beam will probably be uncracked, and thus the whole\\ncross section is effective, as shown for Section 3–3 in the ﬁgure. (For this caseI is usually\\ncalculated only for the web, and the effect of the ﬂanges is neglected, as shown in Figure 6.10.)\\nFrom the preceding discussion it is obvious that to calculate the deﬂection in a continuous\\nbeam, theoretically it is necessary to use a deﬂection procedure that takes into account the\\nvarying moment of inertia along the span. Such a procedure would be very lengthy, and it is\\ndoubtful that the results so obtained would be within±20% of the actual values.

The remainder of this chapter is concerned\\nwith the estimated widths of ﬂexural cracks and recommended maximum spacings of ﬂexural\\nbars to control cracks.\\nFlexural cracks are vertical cracks that extend from the tension sides of beams up to\\nthe region of their neutral axes. They are illustrated in Figure 6.12(a). Should beams have\\nvery deep webs (more than 3 ft or 4 ft), the cracks will be very closely spaced, with some of\\nthem coming together above the reinforcing and some disappearing there. These cracks may\\nbe wider up in the middle of the beam than at the bottom.\\nFIGURE 6 . 1 2 Some types of cracks in concrete members.\\n7 ACI Committee 435, 1978, “Proposed Revisions by Committee 435 to ACI Building Code and Commentary Provisions on\\nDeﬂections,” Journal ACI, 75(6), pp. 229–238.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 190}, page_content='McCormac c06.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:03 P.M. Page 171\\n6.10 Control of Flexural Cracks 171\\nInclined cracks due to shear can develop in the webs of reinforced concrete beams\\neither as independent cracks or as extensions of ﬂexural cracks. Occasionally, inclined cracks\\nwill develop independently in a beam, even though no ﬂexural cracks are in that locality.\\nThese cracks, which are called web-shear cracks and which are illustrated in Figure 6.12(b),\\nsometimes occur in the webs of prestressed sections, particularly those with large ﬂanges and\\nthin webs.\\nThe usual type of inclined shear cracks are the ﬂexure-shear cracks, which are illustrated\\nin Figure 6.12(c). They commonly develop in both prestressed and nonprestressed beams.\\nTorsion cracks, which are illustrated in Figure 6.12(d), are quite similar to shear cracks\\nexcept that they spiral around the beam. Should a plain concrete member be subjected to pure\\ntorsion, it will crack and fail along 45◦ spiral lines due to the diagonal tension corresponding\\nto the torsional stresses. For a very effective demonstration of this type of failure, you can take\\na piece of chalk in your hands and twist it until it breaks. Although torsion stresses are very\\nsimilar to shear stresses, they will occur on all faces of a member. As a result, they add to the\\nshear stresses on one side and subtract from them on the other.\\nSometimes bond stresses between the concrete and the reinforcing lead to a splitting\\nalong the bars, as shown in Figure 6.12(e).\\nOf course, there are other types of cracks not illustrated here. Members that are loaded\\nin axial tension will have transverse cracks through their entire cross sections. Cracks can\\nalso occur in concrete members due to shrinkage, temperature change, settlements, and so on.\\nConsiderable information concerning the development of cracks is available. 8\\n6.10 Control of Flexural Cracks\\nCracks are going to occur in reinforced concrete structures because of concrete’s low tensile\\nstrength. For members with low steel stresses at service loads, the cracks may be very small and\\nin fact may not be visible except upon careful examination. Such cracks, called microcracks,\\nare generally initiated by bending stresses.\\nWhen steel stresses are high at service load, particularly where high-strength steels are\\nused, visible cracks will occur. These cracks should be limited to certain maximum sizes so\\nthat the appearance of the structure is not spoiled and so that corrosion of the reinforcing does\\nnot result. The use of high-strength bars and the strength method of design have made crack\\ncontrol a very important item indeed. Because the yield stresses of reinforcing bars in general\\nuse have increased from 40 ksi to 60 ksi and above, it has been rather natural for designers to\\nspecify approximately the same size bars as they are accustomed to using, but fewer of them.\\nThe result has been more severe cracking of members.\\nAlthough cracks cannot be eliminated, they can be limited to acceptable sizes by spread-\\ning out or distributing the reinforcement. In other words, smaller cracks will result if several\\nsmall bars are used with moderate spacings rather than a few large ones with large spacings.\\nSuch a practice will usually result in satisfactory crack control even for Grades 60 and 75 bars.\\nAn excellent rule of thumb to use as regards cracking is “ don’t use a bar spacing larger than\\nabout 9 in.”\\nThe maximum crack widths that are considered to be acceptable vary from approximately\\n0.004 in. to 0.016 in., depending on the location of the member in question, the type of\\nstructure, the surface texture of the concrete, illumination, and other factors. Somewhat smaller\\nvalues may be required for members exposed to very aggressive environments, such as deicing\\nchemicals and saltwater spray.\\n8 Wight, J. K. and MacGregor, J.

To estimate crack widths successfully with the Gergely–Lutz\\nequation when bundled bars are used, it is n ecessary to take into account this reduced contact\\nsurface.11\\n11 Nawy, E.

Page 175\\n6.11 ACI Code Provisions Concerning Cracks 175\\nWhen bundled bars are present, some designers use a very conservative procedure in\\ncomputing the value of A. For this calculation they assume each bundle is one bar, that bar\\nhaving an area equal to the total area of the bars in that bundle. Certainly, the bond properties\\nof a group of bundled bars are better than those of a single large “equivalent bar.”\\nParticular attention needs to be given to crack control for doubly reinforced beams, where\\nit is common to use small numbers of large-diameter tensile bars. Calculation of crack widths\\nfor such beams may result in rather large values, thus in effect requiring the use of a larger\\nnumber of rather closely spaced smaller bars.\\nSpecial rules are given in ACI Section 10.6.6 for the spacings of reinforcing to help\\ncontrol the amount of cracking in T beams whose ﬂanges are in tension.\\n6.11 ACI Code Provisions Concerning Cracks\\nIn the ACI Code, Sections 10.6.3 and 10.6.4 require that ﬂexural tensile reinforcement be\\nwell distributed within the zones of maximum tension so that the center-to-center spacing of\\nthe reinforcing closest to a tension surface is not greater than the value computed with the\\nfollowing expression:\\ns = (15)\\n(40,000\\nfs\\n⎡\\n− 2.5cc ≤ (12)\\n(40,000\\nfs\\n⎡\\n(ACI Equation 10-4)\\nIn this expression, fs is the computed tensile stress at working load. It may be calculated\\nby dividing the unfactored bending moment by the beam’s internal moment arm (see Example\\n2.3), or it may simply be taken equal to 2\\n3 fy.T h et e r mcc represents the clear cover from the\\nnearest surface in tension to the surface of the tensile reinforcement in inches.\\nFor beams with Grade 60 reinforcing and with 2-in. clear cover, the maximum code-\\npermitted bar spacing is\\ns = (15)\\n( 40,000\\n0.667 × 60,000 psi\\n⎡\\n− (2.5)(2i n .)\\n= 10.0 in. <( 12)\\n( 40,000\\n0.667 × 60,000 psi\\n⎡\\n= 12.0 in.\\nA bar spacing not more than 10.0 in. would thus be required. This limit can control the\\nspacing of bars in one-way slabs but is not likely to control beam bar spacings.\\nThe authors feel that these ACI maximum bar-spacing provisions are quite reasonable\\nfor one-way slabs and for beams with wide webs. For beams with normal web widths used in\\nordinary buildings, we also feel that estimating crack widths with the Gergely–Lutz equation\\nand comparing the results to the values given in Table 6.3 of this chapter may be a more\\nreasonable procedure.12\\nThe ACI equation for maximum spacing does not apply to beams with extreme exposure\\nor to structures that are supposed to be watertight. Special consideration must be given to such\\nsituations. It is probably well to use the Gergely–Lutz equation and a set of maximum crack\\nwidths, such as those of Table 6.3, for such situations.\\nThe effect of cracks and their widths on the corrosion of reinforcing is not clearly\\nunderstood. There does not seem to be a direct relationship between crack widths and corrosion,\\nat least at the reinforcing stresses occurring when members are subjected to service loads. Thus\\nthe ACI Code no longer distinguishes between interior and exterior exposure, as it once did.\\nResearch seems to indicate that the total corrosion occurring in reinforcing is not clearly\\ncorrelated to crack widths. It is true, however, that the time required for corrosion to begin in\\nreinforcing is inversely related to the widths of cracks.\\n12 Ibid., p. 303.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 195}, page_content='McCormac c06.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:03 P.M.

At other points in the beams, the moments were less.\\nAlthough it is possible to vary beam depths in some proportion to the bending moments, it is\\nnormally more economical to use prismatic sections and reduce or cut off some reinforcing\\nwhen the bending moments are sufﬁciently small. Reinforcing steel is quite expensive, and\\ncutting it off where possible may appreciably reduce costs.\\nShould the bending moment fall off 50% from its maximum, approximately 50% of\\nthe bars can be cut off or perhaps bent up or down to the other face of the beam and made\\ncontinuous with the reinforcing in the other face. For this discussion, the uniformly loaded\\nsimple beam of Figure 7.1 is considered. This beam has six bars, and it is desired to cut off\\ntwo bars when the moment falls off a third and two more bars when it falls off another third.\\nFor the purpose of this discussion, the maximum moment is divided into three equal parts by\\nthe horizontal lines shown. If the moment diagram is drawn to scale, a graphical method is\\nsatisfactory for ﬁnding the theoretical cutoff points.\\nFor the parabolic moment diagram of Figure 7.1, the following expressions can be written\\nand solved for the bar lengths x1 and x2 shown in the ﬁgure:\\nx2\\n1\\n(l/2)2 = 2\\n6\\nx2\\n2\\n(l/2)2 = 4\\n6\\nFor different-shaped moment diagrams, other mathematical expressions would have to\\nbe written, or a graphical method used.\\nActually, the design ultimate moment capacity\\nφMn = φAs fy\\n(\\nd − a\\n2\\n⎡\\ndoes not vary exactly in proportion to the area of the reinforcing bars, as is illustrated in\\nExample 7.1, because of variations in the depth of the compression block as the steel area is\\nchanged. The change is so slight, however, that for all practical purposes, the moment capacity\\nof a beam can be assumed to be directly proportional to the steel area.\\nIt w ill be shown int his chapter that the moment capac ities calculated as illustrated in\\nthis example problem w ill have to be reduced if sufﬁcient lengths are not prov ided beyond the\\ntheoretical cutoff points for the bars to develop the ir full stresses.\\n184'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 204}, page_content='McCormac c07.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:09 P.M.

As will be seen in\\nsubsequent sections of this chapter, the bars will have to be run additional distances because\\nof variations of moment diagrams, anchorage requirements of the bars, and so on.\\n7.2 Bond Stresses\\nA basic assumption made for reinforced concrete design is that there must be absolutely no\\nslippage of the bars in relation to the surrounding concrete. In other words, the steel and the\\nconcrete should stick together, or bond, so that they will act as a unit. If there is no bonding\\nbetween the two materials and if the bars are not anchored at their ends, they will pull loose\\nfrom the concrete. As a result, the concrete beam will act as an unreinforced member and will\\nbe subject to sudden collapse as soon as the concrete cracks.\\nIt is obvious that the magnitude of bond stresses will change in a reinforced concrete\\nbeam as the bending moments in the beam change. The greater the rate of bending moment\\nchange (occurring at locations of high shear), the greater will be the rate of change of bar\\ntensions and, thus, bond stresses.\\nWhat may not be so obvious is the fact that bond stresses are also drastically affected by\\nthe development of tension cracks in the concrete. At a point where a crack occurs, all of the\\nlongitudinal tension will be resisted by the reinforcing bar. At a small distance along the bar\\nat a point away from the crack, the longitudinal tension will be resisted by both the bar and\\nthe uncracked concrete. In this small distance, there can be a large change in bar tension due\\nto the fact that the uncracked concrete is now resisting tension. Thus the bond stress in the\\nsurrounding concrete, which was zero at the crack, will drastically change within this small\\ndistance as the tension in the bar changes.\\nIn the past, it was common to compute the maximum theoretical bond stresses at points\\nin the members and to compare them with certain allowable values obtained by tests.

Even if the bars are completely separated from the concrete over\\nconsiderable parts of their length, the ultimate strength of the beam will not be affected if the\\nbars are so anchored at their ends that they cannot pull loose.\\nThe bonding of the reinforcing bars to the concrete is due to several factors, including the\\nchemical adhesion between the two materials, the friction due to the natural roughness of the\\nbars, and the bearing of the closely spaced rib-shaped deformations on the bar surfaces against\\nthe concrete. The application of the force P to the bar shown in Figure 7.5 is considered in\\nthe discussion that follows.\\nWhen the force is ﬁrst applied to the bar, the resistance to slipping is provided by the\\nadhesion between the bar and the concrete. If plain bars were used, it would not take much\\ntension in the bars to break this adhesion, particularly adjacent to a crack in the concrete.\\nIf this were to happen for a smooth surface bar, only friction would remain to keep the bar\\nfrom slipping. There is also some Poisson’s effect due to the tension in the bars. As they are\\ntensioned, they become a little smaller, enabling them to slip more easily. If we were to use\\nstraight, plain, or smooth reinforcing bars in beams, there would be very little bond strength,\\nand the beams would be only a little stronger than if there were no bars. Deformed bars were\\nintroduced so that in addition to the adhesion and friction, there would also be a resistance due\\nto the bearing of the concrete on the lugs or ribs (or deformations) of the bars as well as the\\nso-called shear-friction strength of the concrete between the lugs.\\nDeformed bars are used in almost all work. However, plain bars or plain wire fabrics\\nare sometimes used for transverse reinforcement in compression members (as ties or spirals,\\nas described in Chapter 9), for members subject to torsion, and for conﬁning reinforcing in\\nsplices (ACI R3.5.4).\\nAs a result of these facts, reinforcing bars are made with rib-type deformations. The\\nchemical adhesion and friction between the ribs are negligible, and thus bond is primarily\\nsupplied by bearing on the ribs. Based on testing, the crack patterns in the concrete show that\\nthe bearing stresses are inclined to the axis of the bars from about 45◦ to 80◦ (the angle being\\nappreciably affected by the shape of the ribs). 1\\nCourtesy of Clemson University Communications Center.\\nTwisted square bar, formerly used to increase bond between concrete and steel.\\n1 Goto, Y., 1971, “Cracks Formed on Concrete Around Deformed Tensioned Bar,” ACI Journal, Proceedings 68, p. 244.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 208}, page_content='McCormac c07.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:09 P.M.

These internal forces are caused by the wedging action of the ribs bearing\\nagainst the concrete. They will cause tensile stresses in a cylindrical piece of concrete around\\neach bar. It’s rather like a concrete pipe ﬁlled with water that is pressing out against the pipe\\nwall, causing it to be placed in tension. If the tension becomes too high, the pipe will sp lit.\\nIn a similar manner, if the bond stresses in a beam become too high, the concrete will\\nsplit around the bars, and eventually the splits will extend to the side and/or bottom of the\\nbeam. If either of these types of splits runs all the way to the end of the bar, the bar will slip\\nand the beam will fail. The closer the bars are spaced together and the smaller the cover, the\\nthinner will be the concrete cylinder around each bar and the more likely that a bond-splitting\\nfailure will occur.\\nFigure 7.6 shows examples of bond failures that may occur for different values of concrete\\ncover and bar spacing. These are as shown by MacGregor. 2\\nSplitting resistance along bars depends on quite a few factors, such as the thickness of\\nthe concrete cover, the spacing of the bars, the presence of coatings on the bars, the types of\\naggregates used, the transverse conﬁning effect of stirrups, and so on. Because there are so\\nmany variables, it is impossible to make comprehensive bond tests that are good for a wide\\nrange of structures. Nevertheless, the ACI has attempted to do just this with its equations, as\\nwill be described in the sections to follow.\\n7.3 Development Lengths for Tension Reinforcing\\nFor this discussion, reference is made to the cantilever beam of Figure 7.7. It can be seen that\\nboth the maximum moment in the beam and the maximum stresses in the tensile bars occur\\nat the face of the support. Theoretically, a small distance back into the support the moment\\nis zero, and thus it would seem that reinforcing bars would no longer be required. This is\\nthe situation pictured in Figure 7.7(a). Obviously, if the bars were stopped at the face of the\\nsupport, the beam would fail.\\nThe bar stresses must be transferred to the concrete by bond between the steel and the\\nconcrete before the bars can be cut off. In this case the bars must be extended some distance\\nback into the support and out into the beam to anchor them or develop their strength. This\\ndistance, called the development length (ld ), is shown in Figure 7.7(b). It can be deﬁned as\\n2 MacGregor, J. G., 2005, Reinforced Concrete Mechan ics and Des ign, 4th ed.

A similar case can be\\nmade for bars in other situations and in other types of beams.\\nAs previously mentioned, the ACI for many years required designers to calculate bond\\nstresses with a formula that was based on the change of moment in a beam. Then the computed\\nvalues were compared to allowable bond stresses in the code. Originally, bond strength was\\nmeasured by means of pullout tests. A bar would be cast in a concrete cylinder and a jack\\nwould be used to see how much force was required to pull it out. The problem with such a\\ntest is that the concrete is placed in compression, preventing the occurrence of cracks. In a\\nﬂexural member, however, we have an entirely different situation due to the off-again/on-again\\nnature of the bond stresses caused by the tension cracks in the concrete. In r ecent years, more\\nrealistic tests have been made with beams; the ACI Code development length expressions to be\\npresented in this chapter are based primarily on such tests at the National Institute of Standards\\nand Technology and the University of Texas.\\nThe development lengths used for deformed bars or wires in tension may not be less than\\nthe values computed with ACI Equation 12-1 or 12 in. If the equation is written as (ld /db),\\nthe results obtained will be in terms of bar diameters.

Then their values for different situations are given in\\nTable 7.1.\\n1. Location of reinforcement—Horizontal bars that have a least 12 in. [3] of fresh concrete\\nplaced beneath them do not bond as well to concrete as do bars pl aced nearer the bottom\\nof the concrete. These bars are referred to as top bars. During the placing and vibration\\nof the concrete, some air and excess water tend to rise toward the top of the concrete,\\nand some portion may be caught under the higher bars. In addition, there may be some\\nsettlement of the concrete below. As a result, the reinforcement does not bond as well to\\nthe concrete underneath, and increased development lengths will be needed.

Coating of bars—Epoxy-coated reinforcing bars are frequently used today to protect the\\nsteel from severe corrosive situations, such as where deicing chemicals are used. Bridge\\ndecks and parking garage slabs in the colder states ﬁt into this class. When bar coatings\\nare used, bonding is reduced and development lengths must be increased. Toaccount\\nfor this fact, the term ψe—the coating factor—is used in the equation.\\n3. Sizes of reinforcing—If small bars are used in a member to obtain a certain total cross-\\nsectional area, the total surface area of the bars will be appreciably larger than if fewer\\nbut larger bars are used to obtain the same total bar area.

Page 192\\n192 CHAPTER 7 Bond, Development Lengths, and Splices\\ndevelopment lengths for smaller bars with their larger surface bonding areas (in propor-\\ntion to their cross-sectional areas) are less than those required for larger-diameter bars.\\nThis factor is accounted for with thereinforcement size factor, ψs.\\n4. Lightweight aggregates—The dead weight of concrete can be substantially reduced by\\nsubstituting lightweight aggregate for the regular stone aggregate. The use of such aggre-\\ngates (expanded clay or shale, slag, etc.) generally results in lower-strength concretes.\\nSuch concretes have lower splitting strengths, and so development lengths will have to\\nbe larger. In the equation, λ is the lightweight concrete modiﬁcation factor discussed in\\nSection 1.12.\\n5. Spacing of bars or cover d imensions—Should the concrete cover or the clear spacing\\nbetween the bars be too small, the concrete may very well split, as was previously\\nshown in Figure 7.6. This situation is accounted for with the ( cb + Ktr)/db term in the\\ndevelopment length expression. It is called the conﬁnement term. In the equation, cb\\nrepresents the smaller of the distance from the center of the tension bar or wire to the\\nnearest concrete surface, or one-half the center-to-center spacing of the reinforcement.\\nIn this expression, Ktr is a factor called the transverse reinforcement index.I ti su s e dt o\\naccount for the contribution of conﬁning reinforcing (stirrups or ties) across possible splitting\\nplanes.\\nKtr = 40Atr\\nsn\\nwhere\\nAtr = the total cross-sectional area of all transverse reinforcement having the\\ncenter-to-center spacing s and a yield strength fyt\\nn = the number of bars or wires being developed along the plane of splitting. If steel\\nis in two layers, n is the largest number of bars in a single layer.\\ns = center-to-center spacing of transverse reinforcing\\nThe code in Section 12.2.3 conservatively permits the use of Ktr = 0 to simplify the cal-\\nculations, even if transverse reinforcing is present. ACI 12.2.3 limits the value of ( cb + Ktr)/db\\nused in the equation to a maximum value of 2.5. (It has been found that if values larger than\\n2.5 are used, the shorter development lengths resulting will increase the danger of pullout-type\\nfailures.)\\nThe calculations involved in applying ACI Equation 12-1 are quite simple, as is illustrated\\nin Example 7.2.\\nIn SI units, Ktr =\\nAtr fyt\\n10sn\\nExample 7.2\\nDetermine the development length required for the #8 uncoated bottom bars shown in Figure 7.8,\\n(a) assume Ktr = 0a n d\\n(b) use the computed value ofKtr.\\nSOLUTION\\nFrom Table 7.1\\nψt = 1.0 for bottom bars\\nψe = 1.0 for uncoated bars'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 212}, page_content='McCormac c07.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:09 P.M.

This reduction also is not permitted in regions of high seismic\\nrisk, as described in ACI 318-11, Chapter 21.\\nInstead of using ACI Equation 12-1 for computing development lengths, the ACI in\\nits Section 12.2 permits the use of a somewhat simpler and more conservative approach (as\\nshown in Table 7.2 herein) for certain conditions. With this approach, the ACI recognizes that\\nin a very large percentage of cases, designers use spacing and cover values and conﬁning\\nreinforcing that result in a value of (cb + Ktr)/db equal to at least 1.5. Based on this value and\\nthe appropriate values of ψs, the expressions in Table 7.2 were determined.\\nFor SI values, see Section 12.2.2 of the 318M-11 Code.\\nIf a minimum cover equal to db and a minimum clear spacing between bars of 2 db (or a\\nminimum clear spacing of bars equal to db, along with a minimum of ties or stirrups) are used,\\nthe expressions in Table 7.2 can be used. Otherwise, it is n ecessary to use the more rigorous\\nACI Equation 12-1.\\nThe authors feel that the application of the so-called simpliﬁed equations requires almost\\nas much effort as is needed to use the longer equation. Furthermore, the development lengths\\ncomputed with the “simpler” equations are often so much larger than the ones determined with\\nthe regular equation as to be uneconomical.\\nFor these reasons the authors recommend the use of Equation 12-1 for computing devel-\\nopment lengths. In using this long-form equation, however, you may very well like to assume\\nthat Ktr = 0, as the results obtained usually are only slightly more conservative than those\\nobtained with the full equation. The authors use Equation 12-1 with Ktr = 0 for all applications\\nafter this chapter.\\nExamples 7.3 and 7.4, which follow, present the determination of development lengths\\nusing each of the met hods that have been described in this section.\\nTABLE 7. 2 Simpliﬁed Development Length Equations\\n#6 and Smaller Bars and\\nDeformed Wires\\n #7 and Larger Bars\\nClear spacing of bars being\\ndeveloped or spliced not less\\nthan db, clear cover not less\\nthan db, and stirrups or ties\\nthroughout ld not less than the\\ncode minimum\\n ld\\ndb\\n=\\nfyψtψe\\n25λ\\n√\\nf′\\nc\\nld\\ndb\\n=\\nfyψt ψe\\n20λ\\n√\\nf′\\nc\\nor\\nClear spacing of bars being\\ndeveloped or spliced not less\\nthan 2db and clear cover not\\nless thandb\\nOther cases\\n ld\\ndb\\n=\\n3fyψtψe\\n50λ\\n√\\nf′\\nc\\nld\\ndb\\n=\\n3fyψt ψe\\n40λ√\\nf′\\nc\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 214}, page_content='McCormac c07.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:09 P.M.

The code, Section\\n12.4.1, states that splice and development lengths for bundled bars are to be determined by\\nﬁrst computing the lengths needed for the individual bars and then by increasing those values\\nby 20% for three-bar bundles and 33% for four-bar bundles.\\nWhen the factors relating to cover and clear spacing are being computed for a particular\\nbundle, the bars are treated as though their area were furnished by a single bar. In other words,\\nit is necessary to replace the bundle of bars with a ﬁctitious single bar with a diameter such\\nthat its cross-sectional area equals that of the bundle of bars. This is conservative b ecause the\\nbond properties of the bundled bars are actually better than for the ﬁctitious single bar. When\\ndeterminingcb, the conﬁnement term, and the ψe factor, the bundle is considered to have a\\ncentroid coinciding with that of the bar bundle.

Actually, hooks do not provide an appreciable increase in anchorage strength because the\\nconcrete in the plane of the hook is somewhat vulnerable to splitting. This means that adding\\nmore length (i.e., more than the speciﬁed 12db or 4 db values) onto bars beyond the hooks\\ndoesn’t really increase their anchorage strengths.\\nThe development length needed for a hook is directly proportional to the bar diameter.\\nThis is because the magnitude of compressive stresses in the concrete on the inside of the hook\\nis governed by db.

It is obvious, however, that embedment lengths will\\nbe smaller than those required for tension bars. For one reason, there are no tensile cracks\\npresent to encourage slipping. For another, there is some bearing of the ends of the bars on\\nconcrete, which also helps develop the load.\\nThe code (12.3.2) states that the minimum basic development length provided for com-\\npression bars (ldc) may not be less than the value computed from the following expression.\\nldc = 0.02fy db\\nλ\\n√\\nf ′c\\n≥ 0.0003 fydb but not less than 8 in.\\nOr in SI units\\nldc =\\n0.02fy db\\nλ\\n√\\nf ′c\\n≥ 0.0003 fy db but not less than 200 mm'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 224}, page_content='McCormac c07.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:09 P.M. Page 205\\n7.7 Development Lengths for Compression Bars 205\\nIf more compression steel is used than is required by analysis, ldc may be multiplied\\nby (As required/As provided) as per ACI Section 12.3.3. When bars are enclosed in spirals for any\\nkind of concrete members, the members become decidedly stronger due to the conﬁnement\\nor lateral restraint of the concrete. The normal use of spirals is in spiral columns, which are\\ndiscussed in Chapter 9. Should compression bars be enclosed by spirals of not less than 1\\n4 in.\\ndiameter and with a pitch not greater than 4 in., or within #4 ties spaced at not more than\\n4 in. on center, the value of ldc may be multiplied by 0.75 (ACI 12.3.3). In no case can the\\ndevelopment length be less than 8 in. Thus\\nld = ldc × applicable modiﬁcation factors ≥ 8.0 in.\\nAn introductory development length problem for compression bars is presented in\\nExample 7.7. The forces in the bars at the bottom of the column of Figure 7.18 are to be\\ntransferred down into a reinforced concrete footing by means of dowels. Dowels such as\\nthese are usually bent at their bottoms (as shown in the ﬁgure) and set on the main footing\\nreinforcing where they can be tied securely in place. The bent or hooked parts of the dowels,\\nhowever, do not count as part of the required development lengths for compression bars (ACI\\n12.5.5), as they are ineffective.\\nIn a similar fashion, the dowel forces must be developed up into the column. In\\nExample 7.7, the required development lengths up into the column and down into the footing\\nare different because the f ′\\nc values for the footing and the column are different in this case.\\nThe topic of dowels and force transfer from walls and columns to footings is discussed\\nin some detail in Chapter 12. (The development lengths determined in this example are\\nfor compression bars, as would normally be the case at the base of columns. If uplift is\\npossible, however, it will be necessary to consider tension development lengths, which could\\nvery well control.)\\nExample 7.7\\nThe forces in the column bars of Figure 7.18 are to be transferred into the footing with #9 dowels.\\nDetermine the development lengths needed for the dowels (a) down into the footing and (b) up\\ninto the column iffy = 60,000 psi.

The reason for this requirement is that the code, Chapter\\n21, on seismic design, stipulates that hooks must be embedded in conﬁned concrete.\\n7.8 Critical Sections for Development Length\\nBefore the development length expressions can be applied in detail, it is necessary to understand\\nclearly the critical points for tensile and compressive stresses in the bars along the beam.\\nFirst, it is obvious that the bars will be stressed to their maximum values at those points\\nwhere maximum moments occur. Thus, those points must be no closer in either direction to\\nthe bar ends than theld values computed.\\nThere are, however, other critical points for development lengths. As an illustration, a\\ncritical situation occurs whenever there is a tension bar whose neighboring bars have just been\\ncut off or bent over to the other face of the beam. Theoretically, if the moment is reduced by\\na third, one-third of the bars are cut off or bent, and the remaining bars would be stressed to\\ntheir yield points. The full development lengths would be required for those bars.\\nThis could bring up another matter in deciding the development length required for the\\nremaining bars. The code (12.10.3) requires that bars that are cut off or bent be extended a\\ndistance beyond their theoretical ﬂexure cutoff points byd or 12 bar diameters, whichever\\nis greater. In addition, the point where the other bars are bent or cut off must also be at\\nleast a distance ld from their points of maximum stress (ACI 12.10.4). Thus, these two items\\nmight very well cause the remaining bars to have a stress less than fy, thus permitting their\\ndevelopment lengths to be reduced somewhat. A conservative approach is normally used,\\nhowever, in which the remaining bars are assumed to be stressed tofy.\\n7.9 Effect of Combined Shear and Moment\\non Development Lengths\\nThe ACI Code does not speciﬁcally consider the fact that shear affects the ﬂexural tensile stress\\nin the reinforcing. The code (12.10.3) does require bars to be extended a distance beyond their\\ntheoretical cutoff points by a distance no less than the effective depth of the memberd or'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 226}, page_content='McCormac c07.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:09 P.M. Page 207\\n7.10 Effect of Shape of Moment Diagram on Development Lengths207\\n12 bar diameters, whichever is larger. The commentary (R12.10.3) states that this extension\\nis required to account for the fact that the locations of maximum moments may shift due\\nto changes in loading, support settlement, and other factors. It can be shown that a diagonal\\ntension crack in a beam without stirrups can shift the location of the computed tensile stress a\\ndistance approximately equal to d toward the point of zero moment. When stirrups are present,\\nthe effect is still there but is somewhat less severe.\\nThe combined effect of shear and bending acting simultaneously on a beam may produce\\npremature failure due to overstress in the ﬂexural reinforcing. Professor Charles Erdei 5,6,7 has\\ndone a great deal of work on this topic. His work demonstrates that web reinforcing participates\\nin resisting bending moment. He shows that the presence of inclined cracks increases the force\\nin the tensile reinforcing at all points in the shear span except in the region of maximum\\nmoment. The result is just as though we have a shifted moment diagram, which leads us to the\\nthought that we should be measuringld from the shifted moment diagram rather than from\\nthe basic one. He clearly explains the moment shift and the relationship between development\\nlength and the shift in the moment diagram.\\nThe late Professor P. M. Ferguson8 stated that whether or not we decide to use the shifted\\nmoment concept, it is nevertheless desirable to stagger the cutoff points of bars (and it is better\\nto bend them than to cut them).\\n7.10 Effect of Shape of Moment Diagram\\non Development Lengths\\nA further consideration of development lengths will show the necessity of considering the\\nshape of the moment diagram. To illustrate this point, the uniformly loaded beam of Figure 7.19\\nwith its parabolic moment diagram is considered.

The discussion to follow will prove that this distance is not sufﬁcient to properly develop\\nthe bars for this moment diagram. 9\\nAt the centerline of the beam of Figure 7.19, the moment is assumed to equal Mu,a n d\\nthe bars are assumed to be stressed to fy. Thus the development length of the bars on either\\nside of the beam centerline must be no less than ld . If one then moves along this parabolic\\nmoment diagram on either side to a point where the moment has fallen off to a value of Mu/2,\\nit is correct to assume a required development length from this point equal to ld /2.\\nThe preceding discussion clearly shows that the bars will have to be extended farther\\nout from the centerline than ld . For the moment to fall off 50%, one must move more than\\nhalfway toward the end of the beam.\\n7.11 Cutting Off or Bending Bars (Continued)\\nThis section presents a few concluding remarks concerning the cutting off of bars, a topic that\\nwas introduced in Section 7.1. The last several sections have offered considerable information\\nthat affects the points where bars may be cut off. Here we give a summary of the previously\\nmentioned requirements, together with some additional information. First, a few comments\\nconcerning shear are in order.\\nWhen some of the tensile bars are cut off at a point in a beam, a sudden increase in the\\ntensile stress will occur in the remaining bars. For this increase to occur, there must be a rather\\nlarge increase in strain in the beam. Such a strain increase quite possibly may cause large\\ntensile cracks to develop in the concrete. If large cracks occur, there will be a reduced beam\\ncross section left to provide shear resistance—and thus a greater possibility of shear failure.\\nTo minimize the possibility of a shear failure, Section 12.10.5 of the ACI Code states\\nthat at least one of the following conditions must be met if bars are cut off in a tension zone:\\n1. The shear at the cutoff point must not exceed two-thirds of the design shear strength,φVn,\\nin the beam, including the strength of any shear reinforcing provided (ACI 12.10.5.1).\\n2. An area of shear reinforcing in excess of that required for shear and torsion must be\\nprovided for a distance equal to 3\\n4 d from the cutoff point. The minimum area of this\\nreinforcing and its maximum spacing are provided in Section 12.10.5.2 of the code.\\n3. When #11 or smaller bars are used, the continuing bars should provide twice the area of\\nsteel required for ﬂexure at the cutoff point, and the shear should not exceed three-fourths\\nof the permissible shear (ACI 12.10.5.3).\\nThe moment diagrams used in design are only approximate. V ariations in loading, settle-\\nment of supports, the application of lateral loads, and other factors may cause changes in those\\ndiagrams. In Section 7.9 of this chapter, we saw that shear forces could appreciably offset the\\ntensile stresses in the reinforcing bars, thus in effect changing the moment diagrams. As a result\\nof these factors, the code (12.10.3) says that reinforcing bars should be continued for a distance\\nof 12 bar diameters or the effective depth d of the member, whichever is greater (except at\\nthe supports of simple spans and the free ends of cantilevers), beyond their theoretical cutoff\\npoints.\\nV arious other rules for development lengths apply speciﬁcally to positive-moment rein-\\nforcement, negative-moment reinforcement, and continuous beams.

(Notice that ρ with two bars =\\n1.57 in.2/(18 in.) (27 in.)= 0.00323 <ρ min = 200/60,000 psi= 0.00333, but is considered to be\\nclose enough.) In addition, ld for the bars has been determined to equal 41 in., using ACI\\nEquation 12-1 withλ = 0.75 and Ktr = 0.275 in. based on #3 stirrups ats = 8 in. (similar to\\nExample 7.4).\\nSOLUTION\\nThe solution for this problem is shown in Figure 7.21. There are two bars beginning at the left end\\nof the beam. As no development length is available, the design moment capacity of the member\\nis zero. If we move a distanceld from point A at the left end of the beam to point B, the design\\nmoment capacity will increase in a straight line from 0 to 185.3 ft-k. From point B to point C, it\\nwill remain equal to 185.3 ft-k.\\nAt point C, we reach the cutoff point of the bars, and from C to D (a distance equal told),\\nthe design moment capacity will increase from 185.3 ft-k to 359.7 ft-k. (In Figure 7.21(a) the bars\\nseem to be shown in two layers. They are actually on one level, but the authors have shown\\nthem this way so that the reader can get a better picture of how many bars there are at any point\\nalong the beam.)\\nAt no point along the span may the design strength of the beam be less than the actual\\nbending moment caused by the loads. We can then see that point C is located where the\\nactual bending moment equals 185.3 ft-k. The left reaction for this beam is 44.8 k, as shown in\\nFigure 7.20(a). Using this value, an expression is written for the moment at point C (185.3 ft-k) at\\nad i s t a n c ex from the left support.

It is assumed that this beam will be properly designed for shear\\nas described in the next chapter and will meet the ACI shear requirements.\\n7.12 Bar Splices in Flexural Members\\nField splices of reinforcing bars are often necessary because of the limited bar lengths available,\\nrequirements at construction joints, and changes from larger bars to smaller bars. Although steel\\nfabricators normally stock reinforcing bars in 60-ft lengths, it is often convenient to work in\\nthe ﬁeld with bars of shorter lengths, thus necessitating the use of rather frequent splices.\\nThe reader should carefully note that the ACI Code, Sections 1.2.1(h) and 12.14.1, clearly\\nstate that the des igner is responsible for specifying the types and locat ions for splices for rein-\\nforcement.\\nThe most common method of splicing #11 or smaller bars is simply to lap the bars one\\nover the other. Lapped bars may be either separated from each other or placed in contact,\\nwith the contact splices being much preferred since the bars can be wired together. Such bars\\nalso hold their positions better during the placing of the concrete. Although lapped splices are\\neasy to make, the complicated nature of the resulting stress transfer and the local cracks that\\nfrequently occur in the vicinity of the bar ends are disadvantageous. Obviously, bond stresses\\nplay an important part in transferring the forces from one bar to another. Thus the required\\nsplice lengths are closely related to development lengths. It is necessary to understand that the\\nminimum speciﬁed clear distances between bars also apply to the distances between contact\\nlap splices and adjacent splices or bars (ACI Section 7.6.4).\\nLap splices are not very satisfactory for several situations. They include: (1) where they\\nwould cause congestion; (2) where the laps would be very long, as they are for #9 to #11'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 231}, page_content='McCormac c07.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:09 P.M. Page 212\\n212 CHAPTER 7 Bond, Development Lengths, and Splices\\nGrade 60 bars; (3) where #14 or #18 bars are used because the code (12.14.2) does not permit\\nthem to be lap spliced except in a few special situations; and (4) where very long bar lengths\\nwould be left protruding from existing concrete structures for purposes of future expansion.\\nFor such situations, other types of splices, such as those made by welding or by mechanical\\ndevices, may be used. Welded splices, from the view of stress transfer, are the best splices, but\\nthey may be expensive and may cause metallurgical problems. The result may be particularly\\ndisastrous in high seismic zones. The ACI Code (12.14.3.4) states that welded splices must\\nbe accomplished by welding the bars together so that the connection will be able to develop\\nat least 125% of the speciﬁed yield strength of the bars. It is considered desirable to butt the\\nbars against each other, particularly for #7 and larger bars. Splices not meeting this strength\\nrequirement can be used at points where the bars are not stressed to their maximum tensile\\nstresses. It should be realized that welded splices are usually the most expensive because of\\nthe high labor costs and the costs of proper inspection.\\nMechanical connectors usually consist of some type of sleeve splice, which ﬁts over the\\nends of the bars to be joined and into which a metallic grout ﬁller is pl aced to interlock the\\ngrooves inside the sleeve with the bar deformations. From the standpoint of stress transfer,\\ngood mechanical connectors are next best to welded splices. They do have the disadvantage\\nthat some slippage may occur in the connections; as a result, there may be some concrete\\ncracks in the area of the splices.\\nBefore the speciﬁc provisions of the ACI Code are introduced, the background for these\\nprovisions should be explained brieﬂy. The following remarks are taken from a paper by\\nGeorge F. Leyh of the CRSI.10\\n1. Splicing of reinforcement can never reproduce exactly the same effect as continuous\\nreinforcing.\\n2. The goal of the splice provisions is to require a ductile situation where the reinforcing\\nwill yield before the splices fail. Splice failures occur suddenly without warning and\\nwith dangerous results.\\n3. Lap splices fail by splitting of the concrete along the bars. If some type of closed\\nreinforcing is wrapped around the main reinforcing (such as ties and spirals, described\\nfor columns in Chapter 9), the chances of splitting are reduced and smaller splice lengths\\nare needed.\\n4. When stresses in reinforcement are reduced at splice locations, the chances of splice\\nfailure are correspondingly reduced. For this reason, the code requirements are less\\nrestrictive where stresses are low.\\nSplices should be located away from points of maximum tensile stress. Furthermore,\\nnot all of the bars should be spliced at the same locations—that is, the splices should be\\nstaggered. Should two bars of different diameters be lap spliced, the lap length used shall be\\nthe splice length required for the smaller bar or the development length required for the larger\\nbar, whichever is greater (ACI Code 12.15.3).\\nThe length of lap splices for bundled bars must be equal to the required lap lengths for\\nindividual bars of the same size, but increased by 20% for three-bar bundles and 33% for\\nfour-bar bundles (ACI Code 12.4) because there is a smaller area of contact between the bars\\nand the concrete, and thus less bond. Furthermore, individual splices within the bundles are\\nnot permitted to overlap each other.\\n10 Portland Cement Association, 1972, Proceedingsof the PCA-ACI Teleconference on ACI 318-71 Building Code Requirements\\n(Skokie, IL: Portland Cement Association), p. 14–1.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 232}, page_content='McCormac c07.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:09 P.M.

The class of splice\\nused is dependent on the level of stress in the reinforcing and on the percentage of steel that\\nis spliced at a particular location.\\nClass A spl ices are those where the reinforcing is lapped for a minimum distance of\\n1.0ld (but not less than 12 in.) and where one-half or less of the reinforcing is spliced at any\\none location.\\nClass B splices are those where the reinforcing is lapped for a minimum distance of 1.3 ld\\n(but not less than 12 in.) and where all the reinforcing is spliced at the same location.\\nThe code (12.15.2) states that lap splices for deformed bars and deformed wire in tension\\nmust be Class B unless (1) the area of reinforcing provided is equal to two or more times the\\narea required by analysis over the entire length of the splice and (2) one-half or less of the\\nreinforcing is spliced within the required lap length. A summary of this information is given\\nin Table 7.3, which is Table R12.15.2 in the ACI Commentary.\\nIn calculating the value of ld to be multiplied by 1.0 or 1.3, the reduction for excess\\nreinforcing furnished, As provided/As required, should not be used b ecause the class of splice (A\\nor B) already reﬂects any excess reinforcing at the splice location (see ACI Commentary\\nR12.15.1).\\n7.14 Compression Splices\\nCompression bars may be spliced by lapping, by end bearing, and by welding or mechanical\\ndevices. (Mechanical devices consist of bars or plates or other pieces welded or otherwise\\nattached transversely to the ﬂexural bars in locations where sufﬁcient anchorage is not avail-\\nable.) The code (12.16.1) says that the minimum splice length of such bars should equal\\n0.0005fydb for bars with fy of 60,000 psi or less, (0.0009 fy − 24)db for bars with higher fy\\nvalues, but not less than 12 in. Should the concrete strengths be less than 3000 psi, it is nec-\\nessary to increase the computed laps by one-third. Reduced values are given in the code for\\ncases where the bars are enclosed by ties or spirals (12.17.2.4 and 12.17.2.5).\\nThe required length of lap splices for compression bars of different sizes is the larger of\\nthe computed compression lap splice length of the smaller bars or the compression development\\nlength,ldc of the larger bars. It is permissible to lap splice #14 and #18 compression bars to\\n#11 and smaller bars (12.16.2).\\nThe transfer of forces between bars that are always in compression can be accomplished\\nby end bearing, according to Section 12.16.4 of the code. For such transfer to be perm itted,\\nthe bars must have their ends square cut (within 1 1\\n2\\n◦ of a right angle), must be ﬁtted within 3 ◦\\nof full bearing after assembly, and must be suitably conﬁned (by closed ties, closed stirrups,\\nor spirals). Section 12.17.4 further states that when end-bearing splices are used in columns,\\nin each face of the column more reinforcement has to be added that is capable of providing'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 233}, page_content='McCormac c07.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:09 P.M.

Page 223\\nCHAPTER 8\\nShear and Diagonal Tension\\n8.1 Introduction\\nAs repeatedly mentioned earlier in this book, the objective of today’s reinforced concrete\\ndesigner is to produce ductile members that provide warning of impending failure. To achieve\\nthis goal, the code provides design shear values that have larger safety factors against shear\\nfailures than do those provided for bending failures. The failures of reinforced concrete beams\\nin shear are quite different from their failures in bending. Shear failures occur suddenly with\\nlittle or no advance warning. Therefore, beams are designed to fail in bending under loads that\\nare appreciably smaller than those that would cause shear failures. As a result, those members\\nwill fail ductilely. They may crack and sag a great deal if overloaded, but they will not fall\\napart, as they might if shear failures were possible.\\n8.2 Shear Stresses in Concrete Beams\\nAlthough no one has ever been able to accurately determine the resistance of concrete to pure\\nshearing stress, the matter is not very important because pure shearing stress is probably never\\nencountered in concrete structures. Furthermore,according to engineering mechanics, if pure\\nshear is produced in a member, a principal tensile stress of equal magnitude will be produced\\non another plane. Because the tensile strength of concrete is less than its shearing strength, the\\nconcrete will fail in tension before its shearing strength is reached.\\nYou have previously learned that in elastic homogeneous beams, where stresses are\\nproportional to strains, two kinds of stresses occur (bending and shear), and they can be\\ncalculated with the following expressions:\\nf = Mc\\nI\\nv = VQ\\nIb\\nAn element of a beam not located at an extreme ﬁber or at the neutral axis is subject to\\nboth bending and shear stresses. These stresses combine into inclined compressive and tensile\\nstresses, called principal stresses, which can be determined from the following expression:\\nfp = f\\n2 ±\\n√\\n(f\\n2\\n⎡2\\n+ v2\\nThe direction of the principal stresses can be determined with the formula to follow, in\\nwhich α is the inclination of the stress to the beam’s axis:\\ntan 2α = 2v\\nf\\n223'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 243}, page_content='McCormac c08.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:17 P.M.

It can be seen from the\\npreceding equation that at the neutral axis, the principal stresses will be located at a 45◦ angle\\nwith the horizontal.\\nYou understand by this time that tension stresses in concrete are a serious matter. Diag-\\nonal principal tensile stresses, called diagonal tension, occur at different places and angles in\\nconcrete beams, and they must be carefully considered. If they reach certain values, add itional\\nreinforcing, called web reinforcing, must be supplied.\\nThe discussion presented up to this point relating to diagonal tension applies rather well\\nto plain concrete beams. If, however, reinforced concrete beams are being considered, the\\nsituation is quite different because the l ongitudinal bending tension stresses are resisted quite\\nsatisfactorily by the longitudinal reinforcing. These bars, however, do not provide signiﬁcant\\nresistance to the diagonal tension stresses.\\n8.3 Lightweight Concrete\\nIn the 2008 ACI 318 Code, the effect of lightweight aggregate concrete on shear strength\\nwas modiﬁed by the introduction of the term λ (see Section 1.12). This term was added to\\nmost equations containing\\n√\\nf ′c . The resulting combined term, λ\\n√\\nf ′c , appears throughout this\\nchapter as well as in Chapter 7 on development length and Chapter 15 on torsion. If normal-\\nweight concrete is used, thenλ is simply taken as 1. This uniﬁed approach to the effects\\nof lightweight aggregate on the strength and other properties of concrete is a logical and\\nsimplifying improvement found in the 2008 ACI Code.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 244}, page_content='McCormac c08.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:17 P.M. Page 225\\n8.4 Shear Strength of Concrete 225\\n8.4 Shear Strength of Concrete\\nA great deal of research has been done on the subject of shear and diagonal tension for\\nnonhomogeneous reinforced concrete beams, and many theories have been developed. Despite\\nall this work and all the resulting theories, no one has been able to provide a clear explanation\\nof the failure mechanism involved. As a result, design procedures are based primarily on test\\ndata.\\nIf Vu is divided by the effective beam area, bw d, the result is what is called an average\\nshearing stress. This stress is not equal to the diagonal tension stress but merely serves as an\\nindicator of its magnitude. Should this indicator exceed a certain value, shear or web reinforcing\\nis considered necessary. In the ACI Code, the basic shear equations are presented in terms of\\nshear forces, not shear stresses. In other words, the average shear stresses described in this\\nparagraph are multiplied by the effective beam areas to obtain total shear forces.\\nFor this discussion, Vn is considered to be the nominal or theoretical shear strength of a\\nmember. This strength is provided by the concrete and by the shear reinforcement.\\nVn = Vc + Vs\\nThe design shear strength of a member, φVn , is equal to φVc plus φVs , which must at\\nleast equal the factored shear force to be taken, Vu\\nVu = φVc + φVs\\nThe shear strength provided by the concrete, Vc , is considered to equal an average shear\\nstress strength (normally 2 λ√\\nf ′c ) times the effective cross-sectional area of the member, bw d,\\nwhere bw is the width of a rectangular beam or of the web of a T beam or an I beam.\\nVc = 2λ\\n√\\nf ′c bw d (ACI Equation 11-3)\\nOr in SI units with f ′\\nc in MPa\\nVc =\\n(\\nλ\\n√\\nf ′c\\n6\\n⎡\\nbw d\\nBeam tests have shown some interesting facts about the occurrence of cracks at different\\naverage shear stress values. For instance, where large moments occur even though appropriate\\nlongitudinal steel has been selected, extensive ﬂexural cracks will be evident. As a result,\\nthe uncracked area of the beam cross section will be greatly reduced, and the nominal shear\\nstrength,Vc, can be as low as 1.9 λ\\n√\\nf ′c bw d. In regions where the moment is small, however,\\nthe cross section will be either uncracked or slightly cracked, and a large portion of the cross\\nsection is available to resist shear. For such a case, tests show that aVc of about 3.5 λ\\n√\\nf ′c bw d\\ncan be developed before shear failure occurs. 1\\nBased on this information, the code (11.2.1.1) suggests that, conservatively, Vc (the shear\\nforce that the concrete can resist without web reinforcing) can go as high as 2 λ\\n√\\nf ′c bw d.A s\\nan alternative, the following shear force (from Section 11.2.1.2 of the code) may be used,\\nwhich takes into account the effects of the longitudinal reinforcing and the moment and shear\\n1 ACI-ASCE Committee 326, 1962, “Shear and Diagonal Tension,” part 2, Journal ACI, 59, p. 277.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 245}, page_content='McCormac c08.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:17 P.M.

The quantity Vu d/Mu cannot be\\ntaken to be greater than unity in computing Vc by means of the above expressions.\\nFrom these expressions, it can be seen that Vc increases as the amount of reinforcing\\n(represented by ρw ) is increased. As the amount of steel is increased, the length and width of\\ncracks will be reduced. If the cracks are kept narrower, more concrete is left to resist shear,\\nand there will be closer contact between the concrete on opposite sides of the cracks. Hence\\nthere will be more resistance to shear by friction (calledaggregate interlock) on the two sides\\nof cracks.\\nAlthough this more complicated expression for Vc can easily be used for computer\\ndesigns, it is quite tedious to apply when handheld calculators are used. The reason is that\\nthe values ofρw , Vu ,a n d Mu are constantly changing as we move along the span, requiring\\nthe computation of Vc at numerous positions. As a result, the alternate value 2 λ\\n√\\nf ′c bw d is\\nnormally used. If the same member is to be constructed many times, the use of the more\\ncomplex expression may be justiﬁed.\\n8.5 Shear Cracking of Reinforced Concrete Beams\\nInclined cracks can develop in the webs of reinforced concrete beams, either as extensions\\nof ﬂexural cracks or occasionally as independent cracks. The ﬁrst of these two types is the\\nﬂexure–shear crack, an example of which is shown in Figure 8.1. These are the ordinary types\\nof shear cracks found in both prestressed and nonprestressed beams. For them to occur, the\\nmoment must be larger than the cracking moment, and the shear must be rather large. The\\ncracks run at angles of about 45◦ with the beam axis and probably start at the top of a ﬂexure\\ncrack. The approximately vertical ﬂexure cracks shown are not dangerous unless a critical\\ncombination of shear stress and ﬂexure stress occurs at the top of one of the ﬂexure cracks.\\nOccasionally, an inclined crack will develop independently in a beam, even t hough\\nno ﬂexure cracks are in that locality. Such cracks, which are called web–shear cracks , will\\nflexure–shear cracksecondary crack\\ninitiating or\\nflexural cracks\\nFIGURE 8 . 1 Flexure–shear crack.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 246}, page_content='McCormac c08.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:17 P.M.

They also sometimes occur near the points of inﬂection of continuous beams or near\\nsimple supports. At such locations, small moments and high shear often occur. These types\\nof cracks will form near the mid-depth of sections and will move on a diagonal path to the\\ntension surface. Web–shear cracks are illustrated in Figure 8.2.\\nAs a crack moves up to the neutral axis, the result will be a reduced amount of concrete\\nleft to resist shear—meaning that shear stresses will increase on the concrete above the crack.\\nIt will be remembered that at the neutral axis, the bending stresses are zero, and the\\nshear stresses are at their maximum values. The shear stresses will therefore determine what\\nhappens to the crack there.\\nAfter a crack has developed, the member will fail unless the cracked concrete section\\ncan resist the applied forces. If web reinforcing is not present, the items that are available to\\ntransfer the shear are as follows: (1) the shear resistance of the uncracked section above the\\ncrack (estimated to be 20% to 40% of the total resistance); (2) the aggregate interlock, that\\nis, the friction developed due to the interlocking of the aggregate on the concrete surfaces on\\nopposite sides of the crack (estimated to be 33% to 50% of the total); (3) the resistance of the\\nlongitudinal reinforcing to a frictional force, often called dowel action (estimated to be 15%\\nto 25%); and (4) a tied-arch type of behavior that exists in rather deep beams produced by the\\nlongitudinal bars acting as the tie and by the uncracked concrete above and to the sides of the\\ncrack acting as the arch above.2\\n8.6 Web Reinforcement\\nWhen the factored shear, Vu , is high, it shows that large cracks are going to occur unless some\\ntype of additional reinforcing is provided. This reinforcing usually takes the form of stirrups\\nthat enclose the longitudinal reinforcing along the faces of the beam. The most common\\nstirrups are⊔ shaped, but they can be shaped or perhaps have only a single vertical\\nprong, as shown in Figure 8.3(c). Multiple stirrups such as the ones shown in Figure 8.3(e)\\nare considered to inhibit splitting in the plane of the longitudinal bars. As a consequence, they\\nare generally more desirable for wide beams than the ones shown in Figure 8.3(d). Sometimes\\nit is rather convenient to use lap spliced stirrups, such as the ones shown in Figure 8.3(g).\\nThese stirrups, which are described in ACI Section 12.13.5, are occasionally useful for deep\\nmembers, particularly those with gradually varying depths.However, they are considered to be\\nunsatisfactory ins eismica r e a s.\\nBars called hangers (usually with about the same diameter as that of the stirrups)\\nare placed on the compression sides of beams to s upport the stirrups, as illustrated in\\n2 Taylor, H.

The stirrups are passed around the tensile steel and, to meet anchorage\\nrequirements, they are run as far into the compression side of the beam as practical and hooked\\naround the hangers. Bending of the stirrups around the hangers reduces the bearing stresses\\nunder the hooks. If these bearing stresses are too high, the concrete will crush and the stirrups\\nwill tear out. When a signiﬁcant amount of torsion is present in a member, it will be n ecessary\\nto use closed stirrups as shown in parts (f) through (j) of Figure 8.3 and as discussed in\\nChapter 15.\\nThe width of diagonal cracks is directly related to the strain in the stirrups. Consequently,\\nthe ACI 11.4.2 does not permit the design yield stress of the stirrups to exceed 60 ksi. This\\nrequirement limits the width of cracks that can develop. Such a result is important from the\\nstandpoint of both appearance and aggregate interlock. When the width of cracks is limited,\\nit enables more aggregate interlock to develop. A further advantage of a limited yield stress\\nis that the anchorage requirements at the top of the stirrups are not quite as stringent as they\\nwould be for stirrups with greater yield strengths.\\nThe 60,000-psi limitation does not apply to deformed welded wire fabric b ecause recent\\nresearch has shown that the use of higher-strength wires has been quite satisfactory.

The\\nmaximum stress permitted for deformed welded wire fabric is 80,000 psi (ACI 11.4.2).\\nIn SI units, the maximum design yield stress values that may be used are 420 MPa for\\nregular shear reinforcing and 550 MPa for welded deformed wire fabric.\\n8.7 Behavior of Beams with Web Reinforcement\\nThe actual behavior of beams with web reinforcement is not really understood, although several\\ntheories have been presented through the years. One theory, which has been widely used for 100\\nyears, is the so-called truss analogy, wherein a reinforced concrete beam with shear reinforcing\\nis said to behave much like a statically determinate parallel chord truss with pinned joints. The\\nﬂexural compression concrete is thought of as the top chord of the truss, whereas the tensile\\nreinforcing is said to be the bottom chord. The truss web is made up of stirrups acting as vertical\\ntension members and pieces of concrete between the approximately 45◦ diagonal tension cracks\\nacting as diagonal compression members. 3,4 The shear reinforcing used is similar in its action\\nto the web members of a truss. For this reason, the term web reinforcement is used when\\nreferring to shear reinforcing. A “truss” of the type described here is shown in Figure 8.4.\\nAlthough the truss analogy has been used for many years to describe the behavior of\\nreinforced concrete beams with web reinforcing, it does not accurately describe the manner in\\nwhich shear forces are transmitted. For example, the web reinforcing does increase the shearing\\nstrength of a beam, but it has little to do with shear transfer in a beam before inclined cracks\\nform.\\nThe code requires web reinforcement for all major beams. In Section 11.4.6.1, a minimum\\narea of web reinforcing is required for all concrete ﬂexural members except (a) footings and\\nsolid slabs; (b) certain hollow-core units; (c) concrete ﬂoor joists; (d) shallow beams with h not\\nmore than 10 in.; (e) beams integral with slabs with h less than 24 in. and h not greater than\\nthe larger of two and a half times their ﬂange thicknesses or one-half their web widths; or (f)\\nbeams constructed with steel ﬁber–reinforced, normal-weight concrete with f ′\\nc not exceeding\\n6000 psi, h not greater than 24 in., and Vu not greater than 2φ\\n√\\nf ′c bw d.

For joists, the redistribution is via the slabs to adjacent\\njoists. Hooked or crimped steel ﬁbers in dosages ≥100 lb per cubic yard exhibit higher shear\\nstrengths in laboratory tests. However, use of such ﬁbers is not recommended when the concrete\\nis exposed to chlorides, such as deicing salts.\\nInclined or diagonal stirrups lined up approximately with the principal stress directions\\nare more efﬁcient in carrying the shears and preventing or delaying the formation of diagonal\\ncracks. Such stirrups, however, are not usually considered to be very practical in the United\\nStates because of the high labor costs required for positioning them. Actually, they can be\\nrather practical for precast concrete beams where the bars and stirrups are preassembled into\\ncages before being used and where the same beams areduplicated many times.\\nBent-up bars (usually at 45 ◦ angles) are another satisfactory type of web reinforcing\\n(see Figure 8.5). Although bent-up bars are commonly used in ﬂexural members in the United\\nStates, the average designer seldom considers the fact that they can resist diagonal tension.\\nTwo reasons for not counting their contribution to diagonal tension resistance are that there\\nare only a few, if any, bent-up bars in a beam and that they may not be conveniently located\\nfor use as web reinforcement.\\nDiagonal cracks will occur in beams with shear reinforcing at almost the same loads at\\nwhich they occur in beams of the same size without shear reinforcing. The shear reinforcing\\nmakes its presence known only after the cracks begin to form. At that time, beams must have\\nsufﬁcient shear reinforcing to resist the shear force not resisted by the concrete.\\nAfter a shear crack has developed in a beam, only a little shear can be transferred across\\nthe crack unless web reinforcing is used to bridge the gap. When such reinforcing is present,\\nit keeps the pieces of concrete on the two sides of the crack from separating. Several beneﬁts\\nresult. These include:\\n1. The steel reinforcing passing across the cracks carries shear directly.\\n2. The reinforcing keeps the cracks from becoming larger, and this enables the concrete to\\ntransfer shear across the cracks by aggregate interlock.\\n3. The stirrups wrapped around the core of concrete act like hoops and thus increase the\\nbeam’s strength and ductility. In a related fashion, the stirrups tie the longitudinal bars\\ninto the concrete core of the beam and restrain them from prying off the covering\\nconcrete.\\n4. The holding together of the concrete on the two sides of the cracks helps keep the\\ncracks from moving into the compression zone of the beam.

The value of φVc is provided\\nin the code for different situations, and thus we are able to compute the required value of φVs\\nfor each situation:\\nVu ≤ φVc + φVs\\nFor this derivation, an equal sign is used:\\nVu = φVc + φVs\\nThe purpose of stirrups is to minimize the size of diagonal tension cracks or to carry the\\ndiagonal tension stress from one side of the crack to the other. V ery little tension is carried by\\nthe stirrups until after a crack begins to form. Before the inclined cracks begin to form, the\\nstrain in the stirrups is equal to the strain in the adjacent concrete. Because this concrete cracks\\nat very low diagonal tensile stresses, the stresses in the stirrups at that time are very small,\\nperhaps only 3 ksi to 6 ksi. You can see that these stirrups do not prevent inclined cracks and\\nthat they really aren’t a signiﬁcant factor until the cracks begin to develop.\\nTests made on reinforced concrete beams show that they will not fail by the widening\\nof the diagonal tension cracks until the stirrups going across the cracks have been stressed to\\ntheir yield stresses. For the derivation to follow, it is assumed that a diagonal tension crack has\\ndeveloped and has run up into the compression zone but not all the way to the top, as shown\\nin Figure 8.6. It is further assumed that the stirrups crossing the crack have yielded.\\nThe nominal shear strength of the stirrups, Vs , crossing the crack can be calculated from\\nthe following expression, where n is the number of stirrups crossing the crack and Av is the\\ncross-sectional area each stirrup has crossing the crack. If a ⊔ stirrup is used, Av equals two\\ntimes the cross-sectional area of the stirrup bar. If it is a stirrup, Av equals four times the\\ncross-sectional area of the stirrup bar. The term fyt is the speciﬁed yield strength of transverse\\nreinforcement, or stirrups in this case.\\nVs = Av fyt n\\nIf it is conservatively assumed that the horizontal projection of the crack equals the\\neffective depth, d, of the section (thus a 45 ◦ crack), the number of stirrups crossing the crack\\ncan be determined from the expression to follow, in which s is the center-to-center spacing of\\nthe stirrups:\\nn = d\\ns\\nAv fyt\\nVu\\nd\\nss\\nd\\n FIGURE 8 . 6 Beam with diagonal crack and\\nvertical stirrups.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 251}, page_content='McCormac c08.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:17 P.M.

When the factored shear, Vu , exceeds one-half the shear design strength, φVc ,t h e\\ncode (11.4.6.1) requires the use of web reinforcing. The value of Vc is normally taken as\\n2λ\\n√\\nf ′c bw d, but the code (11.2.2.1) permits the use of the following less conservative value:\\nVc =\\n(\\n1.9λ\\n√\\nf ′c + 2500ρw\\nVu d\\nMu\\n⎡\\nbw d ≤ 3.5λ\\n√\\nf ′c bw d (ACI Equation 11-5)\\nAs previously mentioned, Mu is the moment occurring simultaneously with Vu at the\\nsection in question. The value of Vu d/Mu must not be taken as greater than 1.0 in calculating\\nVc, according to the code.\\n2. When shear reinforcing is required, the code states that the amount provided must fall\\nbetween certain clearly speciﬁed lower and upper limits. If the amount of reinforcing is too\\nlow, it may yield or even snap immediately after the formation of an inclined crack. As soon\\nas a diagonal crack develops, the tension previously carried by the concrete is transferred to\\nthe web reinforcing. To prevent the stirrups (or other web reinforcing) from snapping at that\\ntime, their area is limited to the minimum value provided at the end of the next paragraph.\\nACI Section 11.4.6.3 speciﬁes a minimum amount of web reinforcing so as to\\nprovide an ultimate shear strength no less than 0.75 λ√\\nf ′c bw s.

Such a torque will not cause an appreciable reduction\\nin the ﬂexural or shear strength of a member and may be neglected (ACI Section 11.5.1).

The compu-\\ntation of Tu and Tcr for various situations is presented in Chapter 15.\\nAlthough you may feel that the use of such minimum shear reinforcing is not n ecessary,\\nstudies of earthquake damage in r ecent years have shown very large am ounts of shear damage\\noccurring in reinforced concrete structures, and it is felt that the use of this minimum value will\\ngreatly improve the resistance of such structures to seismic forces. Actually, many designers\\nbelieve that the minimum area of web reinforcing should be used throughout beams, not just\\nwhere Vu is greater than φVc/2.\\nThis requirement for a minimum amount of shear reinforcing may be waived if tests have\\nbeen conducted showing that the required bending and shear strengths can be met without the\\nshear reinforcing (ACI 11.4.6.2).\\n3. As previously described, stirrups cannot resist appreciable shear unless they are\\ncrossed by an inclined crack. Thus, to make sure that each 45 ◦ crack is intercepted by at\\nleast one stirrup, the maximum spacing of vertical stirrups permitted by the code (11.4.5.1)\\nis the lesser of d/2 or 24 in. for nonprestressed members and 3\\n4 h for prestressed members or\\n24 in. where h is the overall thickness of a member.

These closer spacings\\nwill lead to narrower inclined cracks.\\nAnother advantage of limiting maximum spacing values for stirrups is that closely sp aced\\nstirrups will hold the longitudinal bars in the beam. They reduce the chance that the steel may\\ntear or buckle through the concrete cover or possibly slip on the concrete.\\nUnder no circumstances may Vs be allowed to exceed 8\\n√\\nf ′c bw d (Code 11.4.7.9).6 The\\nshear strength of a beam cannot be increased indeﬁnitely by adding more and more shear\\nreinforcing, because the concrete will eventually disintegrate no matter how much shear rein-\\nforcing is added. The reader can understand the presence of an upper limit if he or she thinks\\nfor a little while about the concrete above the crack. The greater the shear in the member that\\nis transferred by the shear reinforcing to the concrete above, the greater will be the chance of\\na combination shear and compression failure of that concrete.\\n4. Section 11.1.2 of the code states that the values of\\n√\\nf ′c used for the design of web\\nreinforcing may not exceed 100 psi 7 except for certain cases listed in Section 11.1.2.1. In\\nthat section, permission is given to use a larger value for members having the minimum\\nreinforcing speciﬁed in ACI Sections 11.4.6.3, 11.4.6.4, and 11.5.5.2. Members meeting these\\nrequirements for extra shear reinforcing have sufﬁcient postcrack capacities to prevent diagonal\\ntension failures.\\n5. Section 12.13 of the code provides requirements about dimensions, development\\nlengths, and so forth. For stirrups to develop their design strengths, they must be adequately\\nanchored. Stirrups may be crossed by diagonal tension cracks at various points along their\\ndepths.

It can then be seen why they should be bent around longitudinal bars of greater\\ndiameters than their own and extended beyond by adequate development lengths. Should there\\nbe compression reinforcing, the hooking of the stirrups around them will help prevent them\\nfrom buckling.\\nStirrups should be carried as close to the compression and tension f aces of beams as the\\nspeciﬁed cover and longitudinal reinforcing will permit. The ends of stirrup legs should ideally\\nhave 135◦ or 180◦ hooks bent around longitudinal bars, with development lengths as speciﬁed\\nin ACI Sections 8.1 and 12.13. Detailed information on stirrups follows:\\n(a) Stirrups with 90 ◦ bends and 6 db extensions at their free ends may be used for #5 and\\nsmaller bars, as shown in Figure 8.7(a). Tests have shown that 90 ◦ bends with 6 db\\nextensions should not be used for #6 or larger bars (unless fy is 40,000 psi or less)\\nbecause they tend to pop out under high loads.\\n(b) If fy is greater than 40,000 psi, #6, #7, and #8 bars with 90 ◦ bends may be used if the\\nextensions are 12 db [see Figure 8.7(b)]. The reason for this speciﬁcation is that it is\\nnot possible to bend these higher-strength bars tightly around the longitudinal bars.\\n(c) Stirrups with 135 ◦ bends and 6 db extensions may be used for #8 and smaller bars, as\\nshown in Figure 8.7(c).\\n6. When a beam reaction causes compression in the end of a member in the same\\ndirection as the external shear, the shearing strength of that part of the member is increased.\\nTests of such reinforced concrete members have shown that, in general, as long as a gradually\\nvarying shear is present (as with a uniformly loaded member), the ﬁrst crack will occur at\\na distance d from the face of the support. It is therefore permissible, according to the code\\n(11.1.3.1), to decrease somewhat the calculated shearing force for a distance d from the face\\nof the support. This is done by using a Vu in that range equal to the calculated Vu at a distance\\nd from the face of the support.

Such loads will be transmitted directly to the support above the\\n45◦ cracks, with the result that we are not permitted a reduction in the end shear for design\\npurposes.\\nShould the r eaction tend to produce tension in this zone, no shear stress reduction is\\npermitted, b ecause tests have shown that cracking may occur at the face of the s upport or\\neven inside it. Figure 8.8 shows two cases where the end shear reduction is not permitted. In\\nthe situation shown in Figure 8.8(a), the critical section will be at the face of the support. In\\nFigure 8.8(b), an I-shaped section is shown, with the load applied to its tension ﬂange. The\\nloads have to be transferred across the inclined crack before they reach the support. Another\\ncrack problem like this one occurs in retaining wall footings and is discussed in Section 13.10\\nof this text.\\n7. V arious tests of reinforced concrete beams of normal proportions with sufﬁcient web\\nreinforcing have shown that shearing forces have no signiﬁcant effect on the ﬂexural capacities\\nof the beams. Experiments with deep beams, however, show that large shears will often keep\\nthose members from developing their full ﬂexural capacities. As a result, the code requirements\\ngiven in the preceding paragraphs are not applicable to beams whose clear spans divided by\\ntheir effective depths are less than four or for regions of beams that are loaded with concentrated\\nloads within a distance from the support equal to the member depth and that are loaded on\\none face and supported on the opposite face. Such a situation permits the development of\\ncompression struts between the loads and the supports. For such members as these, the code in\\nits Appendix A provides an alternate method of design, which is referred to as “strut and tie”\\ndesign. This method is brieﬂy described in Appendix C of this text. Should the loads be applied\\nthrough the sides or bottom of such members, their shear design should be handled as it is for\\nordinary beams. Members falling into this class include beams, short cantilevers, and corbels.\\nCorbels are brackets that project from the sides of columns and are used to support beams and\\ngirders, as shown in Figure 8.9. They are quite commonly used in precast construction. Special\\nweb reinforcing provisions are made for such members in Section 11.7 of the code and are\\nconsidered in Section 8.12 of this chapter.\\n8. Section 8.11.8 of the ACI Code permits a shear of 1.1 Vc for the ribs of joist\\nconstruction, as where we have closely spaced T beams with tapered webs. For the 10%\\nincrease in Vc , the joist proportions must meet the provisions of ACI Section 8.11. In ACI\\nSection 8.11.2, it is stated that the ribs must be no less than 4 in. wide, must have depths\\nnot more than three and a half times the minimum width of the ribs, and may not have clear\\nspacings between the ribs greater than 30 in.\\nreaction\\n(a) (b)\\nload applied to\\ntension flange\\ncrack\\nload\\nreaction\\nFIGURE 8 . 8 Two situations where end shear reduction is not permitted.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 256}, page_content='McCormac c08.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:17 P.M.

Another\\nalternative is to use stirrups instead of ⊔ stirrups. Different diameter stirrups should not\\nbe used in the same beam, or confusion will result.\\nAs is illustrated in Examples 8.3, 8.5, and 8.6, it is quite convenient to draw the Vu\\ndiagram and carefully label it with values of such items as φVc , φVc/2, and Vu at a distance\\nd from the face of the support and to show the dimensions involved.\\nSome designers place their ﬁrst stirrup a distance of one-half of the end-calculated spacing\\nrequirement from the face. Others put the ﬁrst stirrup 2 in. or 3 in. from the s upport.\\nFrom a practical viewpoint, stirrups are usually spaced with center-to-center dimensions\\nthat are multiples of 3 in. or 4 in. to simplify the ﬁeldwork. Although this procedure may\\nrequire an additional stirrup or two, total costs should be less because of reduced labor costs.\\nA common ﬁeld procedure is to place chalk marks at 2-ft intervals on the forms and to place\\nthe stirrups by eye in between those marks. This practice is combined with a somewhat violent\\nplacing of the heavy concrete in the forms, followed by vigorous vibration. These ﬁeld practices\\nshould clearly show the student that it is foolish to specify odd theoretical stirrup spacings\\nsuch as 4 @ 67\\n16 in. and 6 @ 5 3\\n8 in., because such careful pos itioning will not be achieved in\\nthe actual members. Thus, the designer will normally specify stirrup spacings in multiples of\\nwhole inches and perhaps in multiples of 3 in. or 4 in.\\nWith available computer programs, it is easily possible to obtain theoretical arrangements\\nof stirrups with which the least total amounts of shear reinforcing will be required. The use\\nof such programs is certainly useful to the designer, but he or she needs to take the resulting\\nvalues and revise them into simple economical patterns with simple spacing arrangements—as\\nin multiples of 3 in., for example.\\nA summary of the steps required to design vertical stirrups is presented in Table 8.1.

Then the spacings are smoothed (preferably to\\nmultiples of 3 in.). Also, for this particular beam, we would probably use the d/4 spacing on\\nthrough the 0.68-ft section and then use d/2 the rest of the required distance.\\n8.12 Shear Friction and Corbels\\nIf a crack occurs in a reinforced concrete member (whether caused by shear, ﬂexure, shrinkage,\\netc.) and if the concrete pieces on opposite sides of the crack are prevented from moving apart,\\nthere will be a great deal of resistance to slipping along the crack due to the rough and irregular\\nconcrete surfaces. If reinforcement is provided across the crack to prevent relative displacement\\nalong the crack, shear will be resisted by friction between the faces, by resistance to shearing\\noff of protruding portions of the concrete, and by dowel action of the reinforcing crossing the\\ncrack. The transfer of shear under these circumstances is called shear friction.\\nShear friction failures are most likely to occur in short, deep members subject to high\\nshears and small bending moments. These are the situations where the most nearly vertical\\ncracks will occur. If moment and shear are both large, diagonal tension cracks will occur\\nat rather large angles from the vertical. This situation has been discussed in Sections 8.1\\nthrough 8.11.\\nA short cantilever member having a ratio of clear span to depth ( a/d) of 1.0 or less is\\noften called a bracket or corbel. One such member is shown in Figure 8.19. The shear friction\\nconcept provides a convenient method for designing for cases where diagonal tension design is\\nnot applicable. The most common locations where shear friction design is used are for brackets,\\ncorbels, and precast connections, but it may also be applied to the interfaces between concretes\\ncast at different times, to the interfaces between concrete and steel sections, and so on.\\nWhen brackets or corbels or short, overhanging ends or precast c onnections support\\nheavy concentrated loads, they are subject to possible shear friction failures. The dashed lines\\nin Figure 8.19 show the probable locations of these failures. It will be noted that for the end-\\nbearing situations, the cracks tend to occur at angles of about 20 ◦ from the direction of the\\nforce application.\\nSpace is not taken in this chapter to provide an example of shear friction design, but a\\nfew general remarks are presented. (In Section 12.13 of this text, a numerical shear friction\\nprecast section\\nFIGURE 8 . 1 9 Possible shear friction failures.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 269}, page_content='McCormac c08.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:17 P.M. Page 250\\n250 CHAPTER 8 Shear and Diagonal Tension\\nexample is presented in relation to the transfer of horizontal forces at the base of a column\\nto a footing.) It is ﬁrst assumed that a crack has occurred, as shown by the dashed lines of\\nFigure 8.19. As slip begins to occur along the cracked surface, the r oughness of the concrete\\nsurfaces tends to cause the opposing faces of the concrete to separate.\\nAs the concrete separates, it is resisted by the tensile reinforcement (Avf ) provided across\\nthe crack. It is assumed that this steel is stretched until it yields. (An opening of the crack of\\n0.01 in. will probably be sufﬁcient to develop the yield strength of the bars.) The clamping\\nforce developed in the bars Avf fy will provide a frictional resistance equal to Avf fy μ,w h e r eμ\\nis the coefﬁcient of friction (values of which are provided for different situations in Section\\n11.6.4.3 of the code).\\nThen the design shear strength of the member must at least equal the shear, to be taken\\nas\\nφVn = Vu = φAvf fyμ\\nThe value of fy used in this equation cannot ex ceed 60 ksi, and the shear friction rein-\\nforcement across or perpendicular to the shear crack may be obtained by\\nAvf = Vu\\nφfy μ\\nThis reinforcing should be appropriately pl aced along the shear plane. If there is no\\ncalculated bending moment, the bars will be uniformly spaced. If there is a calculated moment,\\nit will be necessary to distribute the bars in the ﬂexural tension area of the shear plane. The\\nbars must be anchored sufﬁciently on both sides of the crack to develop their yield strength\\nby means of embedment, hooks, headed bars, or other methods. Since space is often limited\\nin these situations, it is often necessary to weld the bars to special devices, such as crossbars\\nor steel angles. The bars should be anchored in conﬁned concrete (i.e., column ties or external\\nconcrete or other reinforcing shall be used).\\nWhen beams are supported on brackets or corbels, there may be a problem with shrinkage\\nand expansion of the beams, producing horizontal forces on the bracket or corbel. When such\\nforces are present, the bearing plate under the concentrated load should be welded down to\\nthe tensile steel. Based on various tests, the ACI Code (11.8.3.4) says that the horizontal force\\nused must be at least equal to 0.2Vu unless special provisions are made to avoid tensile forces.\\nThe presence of direct tension across a cracked surface obviously reduces the shear-\\ntransfer strength. Thus direct compression will increase its strength. As a result, Section 11.6.7\\nof the code permits the use of a permanent compressive load to increase the shear friction\\nclamping force. A typical corbel design and its reinforcing are shown in Figure 8.20.\\nEnough concrete area must also be provided, and Section 11.6.5 of the code gives the\\nupper limits on the shear force, Vn , transferred across a shear-friction failure surface based on\\nconcrete strength and contact area.

These forces\\ncan affect the shear design of our members. Compressive loads tend to prevent cracks from\\ndeveloping. As a result, they provide members with larger compressive areas and thus greater\\nshear strengths. Tensile forces exaggerate cracks and reduce shear resistances because they will\\ndecrease compression areas.\\nWhen we have appreciable axial compression, the following equation can be used to\\ncompute the shear-carrying capacity of a concrete member:\\nVc = 2\\n(\\n1 + Nu\\n2000Ag\\n⎡\\nλ\\n√\\nf ′c bw d (ACI Equation 11-4)\\nFor a member subjected to a signiﬁcant axial tensile force, the shear capacity of the\\nconcrete may be determined from the following expression:\\nVc = 2\\n(\\n1 + Nu\\n500Ag\\n⎡\\nλ\\n√\\nf ′c bw d (ACI Equation 11-8)\\nIn this expression, Nu , the axial load, is minus if the load is tensile.

Such a member is shown in Figure 8.22(a). Some members falling into this class are\\nshort, deep, heavily loaded beams; wall slabs under vertical loads; shear walls; and perhaps\\nﬂoor slabs subjected to horizontal loads.\\nIf the loads are applied through the sides or the bottom (as where beams are framing\\ninto its sides or bottom) of the member, as illustrated in Figure 8.22(b) and (c), the usual\\nshear design provisions described earlier in this chapter are to be followed, whether or not the\\nmember is deep.\\nFIGURE 8 . 2 2 Deep beam conﬁgurations.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 273}, page_content='McCormac c08.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:17 P.M. Page 254\\n254 CHAPTER 8 Shear and Diagonal Tension\\nThe angles at which inclined cracks develop in deep ﬂexural members (measured from\\nthe vertical) are usually much smaller than 45 ◦—on some occasions being very nearly vertical.\\nAs a result, web reinforcing when needed has to be more closely spaced than for beams of\\nregular depths. Furthermore, the web reinforcing needed is in the form of both horizontal and\\nvertical reinforcing. These almost vertical cracks indicate that the principal tensile forces are\\nprimarily horizontal, and thus horizontal reinforcing is particularly effective in resisting them.\\nThe detailed provisions of the code relating to shear design for deep beams, together\\nwith the applicable ACI Section numbers, are as follows:\\n1. Deep beams are to be designed using the procedure described in Appendix A of the\\ncode (Appendix C in this textbook) or by using a nonlinear analysis (ACI 11.7.2).\\n2. The nominal shear strength, Vn , for deep beams shall not exceed 10\\n√\\nf ′c bw d (ACI 11.7.3).\\n3. The area of shear reinforcing, Av , perpendicular to the span must at least equal\\n0.0025 bw s,a n ds may not be greater than d/5 or 12 in. (ACI 11.7.4.1). s is the spacing\\nof the shear or torsion reinforcing measured in a direction parallel to the logitudinal\\nreinforcing.\\n4. The area of shear reinforcing parallel to the span must not be less than 0.0015bw s2,a n ds2\\nmay not be greater than d/5 or 12 in. (ACI 11.7.4.2).s2 is the spacing of shear reinforcing\\nmeasured in a direction perpendicular to the beam’s longitudinal reinforcement.\\nYou will note that more vertical than horizontal shear reinforcing is required because\\nvertical reinforcing has been shown to be more effective than horizontal reinforcing. The\\nsubject of deep beams is continued in Appendix C of this textbook.\\n8.15 Introductory Comments on Torsion\\nUntil recent years, the safety factors required by design codes for pr oportioning members for\\nbending and shear were very large, and the resulting large members could almost always be\\ndepended upon to resist all but the very largest torsional moments. Today, however, with the\\nsmaller members selected using the strength design procedure, this is no longer true, and torsion\\nneeds to be considered much more frequently.\\nTorsion may be very signiﬁcant for curved beams, spiral staircases, beams that have large\\nloads applied laterally off center, and even spandrel beams running between exterior building\\ncolumns. These latter beams support the edges of ﬂoor slabs, ﬂoor beams, curtain walls, and\\nfac¸ades, and they are loaded laterally on one side. Several situations where torsion can be a\\nproblem are shown in Figure 8.23.\\nWhen plain concrete members are subjected to pure torsion, they will crack along 45 ◦\\nspiral lines when the resulting diagonal tension ex ceeds the design strength of the concrete.\\nAlthough these diagonal tension stresses produced by twisting are very similar to those caused\\nby shear, they will occur on all faces of a member. As a result, they add to the stresses caused\\nby shear on one side of the beam and subtract from them on the other.\\nReinforced concrete members subjected to large torsional forces may fail quite suddenly\\nif they are not provided with torsional reinforcing. The addition of torsional reinforcing does\\nnot change the magnitude of the torsion that will cause diagonal cracks, but it does prevent\\nthe members from tearing apart. As a result, they will be able to resist substantial torsional\\nmoments without failure. Tests have shown that both longitudinal bars and closed stirrups\\nor spirals are necessary to intercept the numerous diagonal tension cracks that occur on all\\nsurfaces of beams subject to appreciable torsional forces. There must be a l ongitudinal bar in\\neach corner of the stirrups to resist the horizontal com ponents of the diagonal tension caused\\nby torsion.

Such columns are\\noften said to be “axially loaded.” Short, stocky columns with large bending moments are\\ndiscussed in Chapter 10, while long or slender columns are considered in Chapter 11.\\nConcrete columns can be roughly divided into the following three categories:\\nShort compression blocks or pedestals—If the height of an upright compression member is less\\nthan three times its least lateral dimensions, it may be considered to be a pedestal. The ACI\\n(2.2 and 10.14) states that a pedestal may be designed with unreinforced or plain concrete\\nwith a maximum design compressive stress equal to 0.85 φf ′\\nc,w h e r eφ is 0.65. Should the\\ntotal load applied to the member be larger than 0.85 φf ′\\ncAg, it will be necessary either to\\nenlarge the cross-sectional area of the pedestal or to design it as a reinforced concrete\\ncolumn, as described in Section 9.9 of this chapter.\\nShort reinforced concrete columns— Should a reinforced concrete column fail due to initial\\nmaterial failure, it is classiﬁed as a short column. The load that it can support is controlled by\\nthe dimensions of the cross section and the strength of the materials of which it is constructed.\\nWe think of a short column as being a rather stocky member with little ﬂexibility.\\nLong or slender re inforced concrete columns— As columns become more slender, bending\\ndeformations will increase, as will the resulting secondary moments. If these moments are\\nof such magnitude as to signiﬁcantly reduce the axial load capacities of columns, those\\ncolumns are referred to as being long or slender.\\nWhen a column is subjected to primary moments (those moments caused by applied\\nloads, joint rotations, etc.), the axis of the member will deﬂect laterally, with the result that\\nadditional moments equal to the column load times the lateral deﬂection will be applied to the\\ncolumn. These latter moments are called secondary moments or P/Delta1moments and are illustrated\\nin Figure 9.1.\\nA column that has large secondary moments is said to be a slender column, and it is\\nnecessary to size its cross section for the sum of both the primary and secondary moments.\\nThe ACI’s intent is to permit columns to be designed as short columns if the secondary or\\nP/Delta1effect does not reduce their strength by more than 5%. Effective slenderness ratios are\\ndescribed and evaluated in Chapter 11 and are used to classify columns as being short or\\nslender. When the ratios are larger than certain values (depending on whether the columns are\\nbraced or unbraced laterally), they are classiﬁed as slender columns.\\nThe effects of slenderness can be neglected in about 40% of all unbr aced columns and\\nabout 90% of those br aced against sidesway.1 These percentages are probably decreasing year\\nby year, however, due to the increasing use of slenderer columns designed by the strength\\nmethod, using stronger materials and with a better understanding of column buckling behavior.\\n1 Portland Cement Association, 2005, Notes on ACI 318-05.

Further substantial strength increases may\\nbe made by providing lateral restraint for these longitudinal bars. Under compressive loads,\\ncolumns tend not only to shorten lengthwise but also to expand laterally due to the Poisson\\neffect. The capacity of such members can be greatly increased by providing lateral restraint\\nin the form of closely spaced closed ties or helical spirals wrapped ar ound the longitudinal\\nreinforcing.\\nReinforced concrete columns are referred to as tied or spiral columns, depending on the\\nmethod used for laterally bracing or holding the bars in place. If the column has a series of\\nclosed ties, as shown in Figure 9.2(a), it is referred to as a tied column. These ties are effective\\nin increasing the column strength. They prevent the longitudinal bars from being displaced\\nduring construction, and they resist the tendency of the same bars to buckle outward under\\nload, which would cause the outer concrete cover to break or spall off. Tied columns are\\nordinarily square or rectangular, but they can be octagonal, round, L shaped, and so forth.\\nThe square and rectangular shapes are commonly used b ecause of the simplicity of\\nconstructing the forms. Sometimes, however, when they are used in open spaces, circular\\nshapes are very attractive. The forms for round columns are often made from cardboard or\\nplastic tubes, which are peeled off and discarded once the concrete has sufﬁciently hardened.\\nIf a continuous helical spiral made from bars or heavy wire is wrapped around the lon-\\ngitudinal bars, as shown in Figure 9.2(b), the column is referred to as a spiral column.S p i r a l s\\nare even more effective than ties in increasing a column’s strength. The closely spaced spirals\\ndo a better job of holding the longitudinal bars in place, and they also conﬁne the concrete\\ninside and greatly increase its resistance to axial compression. As the concrete inside the spi-\\nral tends to spread out laterally under the compressive load, the spiral that restrains it is put\\ninto hoop tension, and the column will not fail until the spiral yields or breaks, permitting\\nthe bursting of the concrete inside. Spiral columns are normally round, but they also can be\\nmade into rectangular, octagonal, or other shapes. For such columns, circular arrangements\\nof the bars are still used.

Spirals very effectively increase the ductility and toughness of columns, but they are\\nmuch more expensive than ties.\\nComposite columns, illustrated in Figure 9.2(c) and (d), are concrete columns that are\\nreinforced longitudinally by structural steel shapes, which may or may not be surrounded\\nby structural steel bars, or they may consist of structural steel tubing ﬁlled with concrete\\n(commonly called lally columns).\\n9.3 Axial Load Capacity of Columns\\nIn actual practice, there are no perfect axially loaded columns, but a discussion of such members\\nprovides an excellent starting point for explaining the theory involved in designing real columns\\nwith their eccentric loads. Several basic ideas can be explained for purely axially loaded\\ncolumns, and the strengths obtained provide upper theoretical limits that can be clearly veriﬁed\\nwith actual tests.\\nIt has been known for several decades that the stresses in the concrete and the reinforcing\\nbars of a column supporting a long-term load cannot be calculated with any degree of accuracy.\\nYou might think that such stresses could be determined by multiplying the strains by the\\nappropriate moduli of elasticity. But this idea does not work too well practically because the\\nmodulus of elasticity of the concrete is changing during loading due to creep and shrinkage.\\nThus, the parts of the load carried by the concrete and the steel vary with the magnitude and\\nduration of the loads. For instance, the larger the percentage of dead loads and the longer they\\nare applied, the greater the creep in the concrete and the larger the percentage of load carried\\nby the reinforcement.\\nThough stresses cannot be predicted in columns in the elastic range with any degree\\nof accuracy, several decades of testing have shown that the u ltimate strength of columns can\\nbe estimated very well. Furthermore, it has been shown that the proportions of live and dead\\nloads, the length of loading, and other such factors have little effect on the ultimate strength.\\nIt does not even matter whether the concrete or the steel approaches its ultimate strength ﬁrst.\\nIf one of the two materials is stressed close to its ultimate strength, its large deformations will\\ncause the stress to increase quicker in the other material.\\nFor these reasons, only the ultimate strength of columns is considered here. At failure, the\\ntheoretical ultimate strength or nominal strength of a short axially loaded column is quite accu-\\nrately determined by the expression that follows, in which Ag is the gross concrete area and Ast\\nis the total cross-sectional area of longitudinal reinforcement, including bars and steel shapes:\\nPn = 0.85f ′\\nc(Ag − Ast ) + fyAst\\n9.4 Failure of Tied and Spiral Columns\\nShould a short, tied column be loaded until it fails, parts of the shell or covering concrete will\\nspall off and, unless the ties are quite closely spaced, the l ongitudinal bars will buckle almost\\nimmediately, as their lateral support (the covering concrete) is gone. Such failures may often\\nbe quite sudden, and apparently they have occurred rather frequently in structures subjected to\\nearthquake loadings.\\nWhen spiral columns are loaded to failure, the situation is quite different. The covering\\nconcrete or shell will spall off, but the core will continue to stand, and if the spiral is closely\\nspaced, the core will be able to resist an appreciable amount of additional load beyond the load\\nthat causes spalling. The closely spaced l oops of the spiral, together with the longitudinal bars,\\nform a cage that very effectively conﬁnes the concrete. As a result, the spalling off of the shell of\\na spiral column provides a warning that failure is going to occur if the load is further increased.\\nAmerican practice is to neglect any excess capacity after the shell spalls off, since it\\nis felt that once the spalling occurs, the column will no longer be useful—at least from the'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 286}, page_content='McCormac c09.tex V2 - January 10, 2013 9:37 P.M.

For t his reason, the spiral is designed so that it is\\njust a little stronger than the shell that is assumed to spall off. The spalling gives a warning of\\nimpending failure, and then the column will take a little more load before it fails. Designing\\nthe spiral so that it is just a little stronger than the shell does not increase the column’s ultimate\\nstrength much, but it does result in a more gradual or ductile failure.\\nThe strength of the shell is given by the following expression, where Ac is the area of\\nthe core, which is considered to have a diameter that extends from out to out of the spiral:\\nShell strength = 0.85f ′\\nc(Ag − Ac)\\nBy considering the estimated hoop tension that is produced in spirals due to the lateral\\npressure from the core and by tests, it can be shown that spiral steel is at least twice as effective\\nin increasing the ultimate column capacity as is longitudinal steel.2,3 Therefore, the strength\\nof the spiral can be computed approximately by the following expression, in which ρs is the\\npercentage of spiral steel:\\nSpiral strength = 2ρs Ac fyt\\nEquating these expressions and solving for the required percentage of spiral steel, we\\nobtain\\n0.85f ′\\nc(Ag − Ac ) = 2ρs Ac fyt\\nρs = 0.425\\n(Ag − Ac)f ′\\nc\\nAc fyt\\n= 0.425\\n(Ag\\nAc\\n− 1\\n⎡f ′\\nc\\nfyt\\nTo make the spiral a little stronger than the spalled concrete, the code (10.9.3) speciﬁes\\nthe minimum spiral percentage with the expression to follow, in which fyt is the speciﬁed yield\\nstrength of the spiral reinforcement up to 100,000 psi.\\nρs = 0.45\\n(Ag\\nAc\\n− 1\\n⎡f ′\\nc\\nfyt\\n(ACI Equation 10-5)\\nOnce the required percentage of spiral steel is determined, the spiral may be selected\\nwith the expression to follow, in which ρs is written in terms of the volume of the steel in one\\nloop:\\nρs = volume of spiral in one loop\\nvolume of concrete core for a pitch s\\n=\\nVspiral\\nVcore\\n= as π(Dc − db )\\n(πD2c /4)s = 4as (Dc − db)\\nsD2c\\nIn this expression, as is the cross-sectional area of the spiral bar, Dc is the diameter of the core\\nout to out of the spiral, and db is the diameter of the spiral bar (see Figure 9.3).

Some of the most important limitations are as\\nfollows.\\n1. The percentage of longitudinal reinforcement may not be less than 1% of the gross\\ncross-sectional area of a column (ACI Code 10.9.1). It is felt that if the amount of steel\\nis less than 1%, there is a distinct possibility of a sudden nonductile failure, as might\\noccur in a plain concrete column. The 1% minimum steel value will also lessen creep\\nand shrinkage and provide some bending strength for the column. Actually, the code\\n(10.8.4) does permit the use of less than 1% steel if the column has been made larger\\nthan is necessary to carry the loads because of architectural or other reasons. In other\\nwords, a column can be designed with 1% longitudinal steel to support the factored load,\\nand then more concrete can be added with no increase in reinforcing and no increase\\nin calculated load-carrying capacity. In actual practice, the steel percentage for such\\nmembers is kept to an absolute minimum of 0.005.\\n2. The maximum percentage of steel may not be greater than 8% of the gross cross-sectional\\narea of the column (ACI Code 10.9.1). This maximum value is given to prevent too\\nmuch crowding of the bars. Practically, it is rather difﬁcult to ﬁt more than 4% or 5%\\nsteel into the forms and still get the concrete down into the forms and around the bars.\\nWhen the percentage of steel is high, the chances of having honeycomb in the concrete is\\ndecidedly increased. If this happens, there can be a substantial reduction in the column’s\\nload-carrying capacity. Usually the percentage of reinforcement should not exceed 4%\\nwhen the bars are to be lap spliced. It is to be remembered that if the percentage of steel\\nis very high, the bars may be bundled.\\n3. The minimum numbers of longitudinal bars permissible for compression members (ACI\\nCode 10.9.2) are as follows: four for bars within rectangular or circular ties, three for'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 289}, page_content='McCormac c09.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:43 P.M.

Should there\\nbe fewer than eight bars in a circular arrangement, the orientation of the bars will affect\\nthe moment strength of eccentrically loaded columns. This matter s hould be considered\\nin design according to the ACI Commentary (R10.9.2).\\n4. The code does not directly provide a minimum column cross-sectional area, but it is\\nobvious that minimum widths or diameters of about 8 in. to 10 in. are n ecessary to\\nprovide the n ecessary cover outside of ties or spirals and to provide the n ecessary\\nclearance between longitudinal bars from one face of the column to the other. To use\\nas little rentable ﬂoor space as possible, small columns are frequently desirable. In fact,\\nthin columns may often be enclosed or “hidden” in walls.\\n5. When tied columns are used, the ties shall not be less than #3, provided that the lon-\\ngitudinal bars are #10 or smaller. The minimum size is #4 for longitudinal bars larger\\nthan #10 and for bundled bars. Deformed wire or welded wire fabric with an equivalent\\narea may also be used (ACI 7.10.5.1).\\nIn SI units, ties should not be less than #10 for longitudinal bars #32 or smaller\\nand #13 for larger longitudinal bars.\\nThe center-to-center spacing of ties shall not be more than 16 times the diameter\\nof the longitudinal bars, 48 times the diameter of the ties, or the least lateral dimension\\nof the column. The ties must be arranged so that every corner and alternate longitudinal\\nbar will have lateral support provided by the corner of a tie having an included angle\\nnot greater than 135 ◦. No bars can be located a greater distance than 6 in. clear 4 on\\neither side from such a laterally supported bar. These requirements are given by the\\nACI Code in its Section 7.10.5. Figure 9.4 shows tie arrangements for several column\\ncross sections. Some of the arrangements with interior ties, such as the ones shown in\\nthe bottom two rows of the ﬁgure, are rather expensive. Should longitudinal bars be\\narranged in a circle, round ties may be pl aced around them and the bars do not have to\\nbe individually tied or restrained otherwise (7.10.5.3). The ACI also states (7.10.3) that\\nthe requirements for lateral ties may be waived if tests and structural analysis show that\\nthe columns are sufﬁciently strong without them and that such construction is feasible.\\nThere is little evidence available concerning the behavior of spliced bars and bun-\\ndled bars. For this reason, Section R7.10.5 of the commentary states that it is advisable\\nto provide ties at each end of lap spliced bars and presents recommendations concerning\\nthe placing of ties in the region of end-bearing splices and offset bent bars.\\nTies should not be pl aced more than one-half a spacing a bove the top of a footing\\nor slab and not more than one-half a spacing below the lowest reinforcing in a slab or\\ndrop panel (to see a drop panel, refer to Figure 16.1 in Chapter 16). Where beams frame\\ninto a column from all four directions, the last tie may be below the lowest reinforcing\\nin any of the beams.\\n6. The code (7.10.4) states that spirals may not have diameters less than 3\\n8 in.[5] and that\\nthe clear spacing between them may not be less than 1 in. or greater than 3 in.

The ACI 318 Code (Section 7.10.5.4) states that where longitudinal bars are located\\naround the perimeter of a circle, a complete circular tie is permitted. The ends of the\\ncircular tie must overlap by not less than 6 in. and terminate with standard hooks that\\nengage a longitudinal column bar. Overlaps at ends of adjacent circular ties shall be stag-\\ngered around the perimeter enclosing the longitudinal bars. The code commentary for\\nthis provision warns that vertical splitting and loss of tie restraint are possible where the\\noverlapped ends of adjacent circular ties are anchored at a single l ongitudinal bar. Adja-\\ncent circular ties should not engage the same longitudinal bar with end hook anchorages.\\nWhile the transverse reinforcement in members with longitudinal bars located around\\nthe periphery of a circle can be either spirals or circular ties, spirals are usually more\\neffective.\\n9.6 Safety Provisions for Columns\\nThe values of φ to be used for columns as speciﬁed in Section 9.3.2 of the code are well below\\nthose used for ﬂexure and shear (0.90 and 0.75, respectively).

Page 272\\n272 CHAPTER 9 Introduction to Columns\\nThe failure of a column is generally a more severe matter than is the failure of a beam,\\nbecause a column generally s upports a larger part of a structure than does a beam. In other\\nwords, if a column fails in a building, a larger part of the building will fall down than if a\\nbeam fails. This is particularly true for a lower-level column in a multistory building. As a\\nresult, lowerφ values are desirable for columns.\\nThere are other reasons for using lower φ values in columns. As an example, it is more\\ndifﬁcult to do as good a job in placing the concrete for a column than it is for a beam. The\\nreader can readily see the difﬁculty of getting concrete down into narrow column forms and\\nbetween the longitudinal and lateral reinforcing. As a result, the quality of the resulting concrete\\ncolumns is probably not as good as that of beams and slabs.\\nThe failure strength of a beam is normally dependent on the yield stress of the tensile\\nsteel—a property that is quite accurately controlled in the steel m ills. The failure strength of a\\ncolumn is closely related to the concrete’s ultimate strength, a value that is quite variable. The\\nlength factors also drastically affect the strength of columns and thus make the use of lower φ\\nfactors necessary.\\nIt seems impossible for a column to be perfectly axially loaded. Even if loads could\\nbe perfectly centered at one time, they would not stay in place. Furthermore, columns may\\nbe initially crooked or have other ﬂaws, with the result that lateral bending will occur. Wind\\nand other lateral loads cause columns to bend, and the columns in rigid-frame buildings are\\nsubjected to moments when the frame is supporting gravity loads alone.\\n9.7 Design Formulas\\nIn the pages that follow, the letter e is used to represent the eccentricity of the load. The reader\\nmay not understand this term b ecause he or she has analyzed a structure and has computed\\nan axial load, Pu, and a bending moment, Mu, but no speciﬁc eccentricity, e, for a particular\\ncolumn. The term e represents the distance the axial load, Pu, would have to be off center of\\nthe column to produce Mu. Thus\\nPu e = Mu\\nor\\ne = Mu\\nPu\\nNonetheless, there are many situations where there are no calculated moments for the\\ncolumns of a structure. For many years, the code speciﬁed that such columns had to be\\ndesigned for certain minimum moments even though no calculated moments were present.\\nThis was accomplished by requiring designers to assume certain minimum eccentric ities for\\ntheir column loads. These minimum values were 1 in. or 0.05 h, whichever was larger, for\\nspiral columns and 1 in. or 0.10 h for tied columns. (The term h represents the outside diameter\\nof round columns or the total depth of square or rectangular columns.) A moment equal to the\\naxial load times the minimum eccentricity was used for design.\\nIn today’s code, minimum eccentric ities are not speciﬁed, but the same objective is\\naccomplished by requiring that theoretical axial load capac ities be multiplied by a factor some-\\ntimes called α, which is equal to 0.85 for spiral columns and 0.80 for tied columns. Thus, as\\nshown in Section 10.3.6 of the code, the axial load capacity of columns may not be greater\\nthan the following values:\\nFor spiral columns ( φ = 0.75)\\nφPn (max) = 0.85φ[0.85f ′\\nc(Ag − Ast ) + fy Ast ] (ACI Equation 10-1)'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 292}, page_content='McCormac c09.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:43 P.M.

Short columns can be completely designed with these expressions as long as the e\\nvalues are under the limits described. Should the e values be greater than the limiting values\\nand/or should the columns be classiﬁed as long ones, it will be n ecessary to use the procedures\\ndescribed in the next two chapters.\\n9.8 Comments on Economical Column Design\\nReinforcing bars are quite expensive, and thus the percentage of longitudinal reinforcing used\\nin reinforced concrete columns is a major factor in their total costs. This means that under\\nnormal circumstances, a small percentage of steel should be used (perhaps in the range of\\n1.5% to 3%). This can be accomplished by using larger column sizes and/or higher-strength\\nconcretes. Furthermore, if the percentage of bars is kept in approximately this range, it will be\\nfound that there will be sufﬁcient room for conveniently placing them in the columns.\\nHigher-strength concretes can be used more economically in columns than in beams.\\nUnder ordinary loads, only 30% to 40% of a beam cross section is in compression, while the\\nremaining 60% to 70% is in tension and thus assumed to be cracked. This means that if a\\nhigh-strength concrete is used for a beam, 60% to 70% of it is wasted. For the usual column,\\nhowever, the situation is quite different because a much larger percentage of its cross section is\\nin compression. As a result, it is quite economical to use high-strength concretes for columns.\\nAlthough some designers have used concretes with ultimate strengths as high as 19,000 psi'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 293}, page_content='McCormac c09.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:43 P.M. Page 274\\n274 CHAPTER 9 Introduction to Columns\\n(as at Two Union Square in Seattle) for column design with apparent economy, the use\\nof 5000-psi to 6000-psi columns is the normal rule when higher strengths are speciﬁed for\\ncolumns.\\nGrade 60 reinforcing bars are generally used for best economy in the columns of most\\nstructures. However, Grade 75 bars may provide better economy in high-rise structures, par-\\nticularly when they are used in combination with higher-strength concretes.\\nIn general, tied columns are more economical than spiral columns, particularly if square\\nor rectangular cross sections are to be used. Of course, spiral columns, high-strength concretes,\\nand high percentages of steel save ﬂoor space.\\nAs few different column sizes as possible should be used throughout a building. In this\\nregard, it is completely uneconomical to vary a column size from ﬂoor to ﬂoor to satisfy the\\ndifferent loads it must support. This means that the designer may select a column size for the\\ntop ﬂoor of a multistory building (using as small a percentage of steel as possible) and then\\ncontinue to use that same size vertically for as many stories as possible, by increasing the steel\\npercentage ﬂoor by ﬂoor as required. Furthermore, it is desirable to use the same column size\\nas much as possible on each ﬂoor level. This consistency of sizes will provide appreciable\\nsavings in labor costs.\\nThe usual practice for the columns of multistory reinforced concrete buildings is to\\nuse one-story-length vertical bars tied together in preassembled cages. This is the preferred\\nprocedure when the bars are #11 [8] or smaller, where all the bars can be spliced at one location\\njust above the ﬂoor line. For columns where staggered splice locations are required (as for\\nlarger-size bars), the number of splices can be reduced by using preassembled two-story cages\\nof reinforcing.\\nUnless the least column dimensions or longitudinal bar diameters control tie spacings, the\\nselection of the largest practical tie sizes will increase their spacings and reduce their number.\\nThis can result in some savings. Money can also be saved by avoiding interior ties, such as\\nthe ones shown in the bottom two rows of columns in Figure 9.4. With no interior ties, the\\nconcrete can be placed more easily and lower slumps used (thus lower-cost concrete).\\nIn fairly short buildings, the ﬂoor slabs are often rather thin, and thus deﬂections may\\nbe a problem. As a result, rather short spans and thus close column spacings may be used. As\\nbuildings become taller, the ﬂoor slabs will probably be thicker to help provide lateral stability.\\nFor such buildings, slab deﬂections will not be as much of a problem, and the columns may\\nbe spaced farther apart.\\nEven though the columns in tall buildings may be sp aced at fairly large intervals, they\\nstill will occupy expensive ﬂoor sp ace. For this reason, designers try to place many of their\\ncolumns on the building perimeters so they will not use up the valuable interior space. In\\naddition, the omission of interior columns provides more ﬂexibility for the users for placement\\nof partitions and also makes large open sp aces available.\\n9.9 Design of Axially Loaded Columns\\nAs a brief introduction to columns, the design of three axially loaded short columns is presented\\nin this section and the next.

Page 281\\nCHAPTER 1 0\\nDesign of Short Columns Subject\\nto Axial Load and Bending\\n10.1 Axial Load and Bending\\nAll columns are subjected to some bending as well as axial forces, and they need to be\\nproportioned to resist both. The so-called axial load formulas presented in Chapter 9 do take\\ninto account some moments, b ecause they include the effect of small eccentric ities with the\\n0.80 and 0.85 factors. These values are approximately equivalent to the assumption of actual\\neccentricities of 0.10 h for tied columns and 0.05 h for spiral columns.\\nColumns will bend under the action of moments, and those moments will tend to produce\\ncompression on one side of the columns and tension on the other. Depending on the relative\\nmagnitudes of the moments and axial loads, there are several ways in which the sections might\\nfail. Figure 10.1 shows a column supporting a load,Pn. In the various parts of the ﬁgure, the\\nload is placed at greater and greater eccentric ities (thus producing larger and larger moments)\\nuntil ﬁnally in part (f) the column is subject to such a large bending moment that the effect of\\nthe axial load is negligible. Each of the six cases shown is brieﬂy discussed in the paragraphs\\nto follow, where the letters (a) through (f) correspond to those same letters in the ﬁgure. The\\ncolumn is assumed to reach its u ltimate capacity when the compressive concrete strain r eaches\\n0.003.\\n(a) Large axial load w ith negligible moment—For this situation, failure will occur by the\\ncrushing of the concrete, with all reinforcing bars in the column having reached their\\nyield stress in compression.\\n(b) Large ax ial load and small moment such that the ent ire cross sect ion is in\\ncompression—When a column is subject to a small bending moment (i.e., when the\\neccentricity is small), the entire column will be in compression, but the compression\\nwill be higher on one side than on the other. The maximum compressive stress in the\\ncolumn will be 0.85 f ′\\nc, and failure will occur by the crushing of the concrete with all\\nthe bars in compression.\\n(c) Eccentricity larger than in case (b) such that tens ion begins to develop on one s ide of\\nthe column—If the eccentricity is increased somewhat from the preceding case, tension\\nwill begin to develop on one side of the column, and the steel on that side will be in\\ntension but less than the yield stress. On the other side, the steel will be in compression.\\nFailure will occur as a result of the crushing of the concrete on the compression side.\\n(d) A balanced loading condition—As we continue to increase the eccentricity, a c ondition\\nwill be reached in which the reinforcing bars on the tension side will reach their yield\\nstress at the same time that the concrete on the opposite side r eaches its maximum\\ncompression, 0.85f ′\\nc. This situation is called the balanced loading condition.\\n(e) Large moment w ith small ax ial load —If the eccentricity is further increased, failure\\nwill be initiated by the yielding of the bars on the tensile side of the column prior to\\nconcrete crushing.\\n(f) Large moment with no appreciable axial load—For this condition, failure will occur as\\nit does in a beam.\\n281'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 301}, page_content=\"McCormac c10.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:47 P.M.

The plastic centroid represents the location of the resultant force produced by the\\nsteel and the concrete. It is the point in the column cross section through which the resultant\\ncolumn load must pass to produce uniform strain at failure. For locating the plastic centroid, all\\nconcrete is assumed to be stressed in compression to 0.85f ′\\nc and all steel to fy in compression.\\nFor symmetrical sections, the plastic centroid coincides with the centroid of the column cross\\nsection, while for nonsymmetrical sections, it can be located by taking moments.\\nExample 10.1 illustrates the calculations involved in locating the plastic centroid for a\\nnonsymmetrical cross section.

If a moment with zero axial\\nload is applied to the same member, the result will be bending about the member’s neutral\\naxis such that strain is proportional to the distance from the neutral axis. This linear strain\\nvariation is shown in Figure 10.3(b). Should axial load and moment be applied at the same\\ntime, the resulting strain diagram will be a combination of two linear diagrams and will itself\\nbe linear, as illustrated in Figure 10.3(c). As a result of this linearity, we can assume certain\\nnumerical values of strain in one part of a column and determine strains at other locations by\\nstraight-line interpolation.\\nAs the axial load applied to a column is changed, the moment that the column can resist\\nwill change. This section shows how an interaction curve of nominal axial load and moment\\nvalues can be developed for a particular column.\\nAssuming that the concrete on the compression edge of the column will fail at a strain\\nof 0.003, a strain can be assumed on the far edge of the column, and the values of Pn and\\nMn can be computed by statics. Holding the compression strain at 0.003 on the far edge, we\\ncan then assume a series of different strains on the other edge and calculate Pn and Mn for\\neach.1 Eventually a sufﬁcient number of values will be obtained to plot an interaction curve\\n1 Leet, K., 1991, Reinforced Concrete Design, 2nd ed.

Although it is easily possible to prevent a balanced\\ncondition in beams by requiring that tensile steel strains be kept well above fy/Es,s u c hi s\\nnot the case for columns. Thus, for columns, it is not possible to prevent sudden compression\\nfailures or balanced failures. For every column, there is a balanced loading situation where an\\nultimate load, Pbn, placed at an eccentricity, eb, will produce a moment, Mbn, at which time\\nthe balanced strains will be reached simulataneously.\\nAt the balanced condition, we have a strain of −0.003 on the compression edge of the\\ncolumn and a strain of fy/29 × 103 ksi = 60 ksi/29 × 103 ksi = 0.00207 in the tensile steel.\\nThis information is shown in Figure 10.7. The same procedure used in Example 10.2 is used\\nto ﬁndPn = 504.4 k and Mn = 559.7 ft-k.\\nThe curve for Pn and Mn for a particular column may be extended into the range where\\nPn becomes a tensile load. We can proceed in exactly the same fashion as we did when Pn was\\ncompressive. A set of strains can be assumed, and the usual statics equations can be written\\nand solved forPn and Mn. Several different sets of strains were assumed for the column of\\nFigure 10.4, and then the values of Pn and Mn were determined. The results were plotted at\\nthe bottom of Figure 10.8 and were connected with the dashed line labeled “tensile loads.”\\nPn = 1482 k, Mn = 0\\nPn\\ncompression failure zone\\ncompressive\\nloads\\ntensile\\nloadsaxial\\ntension\\ntension failure zone\\nPn = 623.7 k, Mn = 521.8 ft-k\\nPn = 0, Mn = 297 ft-k\\nPn = 360 k, Mn = 0\\nMn\\nPbn = 504.4 k, Mbn = 559.7 ft-k\\nFIGURE 1 0 . 8 Interaction curve for the column of Figure 10.4.\\nNotice these are nominal values.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 308}, page_content='McCormac c10.tex V2 - January 10, 2013 9:41 P.M.

For the column of Figure 10.4\\nPn = As fy = (6.0 in.2)(60 ksi) = 360 k\\nOn some occasions, members subject to axial load and bending have unsymmetrical\\narrangements of reinforcing.

The same\\ntheory could be used for round columns, but the mathematics would be somewhat complicated\\nbecause of the circular layout of the bars, and the calculations of distances would be rather\\ntedious. Several approximate methods have been developed that greatly simplify the mathe-\\nmatics. Perhaps the best known of these is the one proposed by Charles Whitney, in which\\nequivalent rectangular columns are used to replace the circular ones.2 This method gives results\\nthat correspond quite closely with test results.\\nIn Whitney’s method, the area of the equivalent column is made equal to the area\\nof the actual circular column, and its depth in the direction of bending is 0.80 times the\\noutside diameter of the real column. One-half the steel is assumed to be placed on one side\\nof the equivalent column and one-half on the other. The distance between these two areas\\nof steel is assumed to equal two-thirds of the diameter (Ds) of a circle passing through the\\ncenter of the bars in the real column. These values are illustrated in Figure 10.9. Once the\\nequivalent column is established, the calculations for Pn and Mn are made as for rectangular\\ncolumns.\\n2 Whitney, Charles S., 1942, “Plastic Theory of Reinforced Concrete Design,” Transactions ASCE, 107, pp. 251–326.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 309}, page_content='McCormac c10.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:47 P.M.

Preparing an interaction curve with a hand calculator for just\\none column, however, is quite tedious. Imagine the work involved in a design situation where\\nvarious sizes, concrete strengths, and steel percentages need to be considered. Consequently,\\ndesigners resort almost completely to computer programs, computer-generated interaction\\ndiagrams, or tables for their column calculations. The remainder of this chapter is concerned\\nprimarily with computer-generated interaction diagrams such as the one in Figure 10.10.\\nAs we have seen, such a diagram is drawn for a column as the load changes from one of a\\npure axial nature through varying combinations of axial loads and moments and on to a pure\\nbending situation.\\nInteraction diagrams are useful for studying the strengths of columns with varying pro-\\nportions of loads and moments. Any combination of loading that falls inside the curve is\\nsatisfactory, whereas any combination falling outside the curve represents failure.\\nIf a column is loaded to failure with an axial load only, the failure will occur at point A\\non the diagram (Figure 10.10). Moving out from point A on the curve, the axial load capacity\\ndecreases as the proportion of bending moment increases. At the very bottom of the curve,\\npointC represents the bending strength of the member if it is subjected to moment only with\\nno axial load present. In between the extreme points A and C, the column fails because of\\na combination of axial load and bending. Point B is called the balanced point and represents\\nthe balanced loading case, where theoretically a compression failure and tensile yielding occur\\nsimultaneously.\\nRefer to point D on the curve. The horizontal and vertical dashed lines to this point\\nindicate a particular combination of axial load and moment at which the column will fail.\\nShould a radial line be drawn from point 0 to the interaction curve at any point (as to D in\\nthis case), it will represent a constant eccentricity of load, that is, a constant ratio of moment\\nto axial load.\\nYou may be somewhat puzzled by the shape of the lower part of the curve from B to\\nC, where bending predominates. From A to B on the curve, the moment capacity of a section\\nincreases as the axial load decreases, but just the opposite occurs from B to C. A little thought\\non this point, however, shows that the result is quite logical after all. The part of the curve\\nfromB to C represents the range of tensile failures. Any axial compressive load in that range\\ntends to reduce the stresses in the tensile bars, with the result that a larger moment can be\\nresisted.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 310}, page_content='McCormac c10.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:47 P.M.

If eight #9 bars had been used in the same dimension column,\\nanother curve could be generated as shown in the ﬁgure; if ten #9 bars were used, still another\\ncurve would result. The shape of the new diagrams would be the same as for the six #9 curve,\\nbut the values of Pn and Mn would be larger.\\n10.5 Code Modiﬁcations of Column\\nInteraction Diagrams\\nIf interaction curves for Pn and Mn values were prepared, they would be of the types shown in\\nFigures 10.10 and 10.11. To use such curves to obtain design values, they would have to have\\nthree modiﬁcations made to them as speciﬁed in the code. These modiﬁcations are as follows:\\n(a) ACI Code 9.3.2 speciﬁes strength reduction or φ factors (0.65 for tied columns and\\n0.75 for spiral columns) that must be multiplied by Pn values. If a Pn curve for a\\nparticular column were multiplied by φ, the result would be a curve something like the\\nones shown in Figure 10.12.\\n(b) The second modiﬁcation also refers to φ factors. The code speciﬁes values of 0.65\\nand 0.75 for tied and spiral columns, respectively.

For instance, for a member in pure bending (point C on the\\nsame curve), the speciﬁed φ is 0.90, but if the same member has a very small axial\\nload added, φ would immediately fall to 0.65 or 0.75. Therefore, the code (9.3.2.2)\\nstates that when members subject to axial load and bending have net tensile strains ( ϵt)\\nbetween the limits for compression-controlled and tensile-controlled sections, they fall\\nin the transition zone forφ. In this zone, it is permissible to increase φ linearly from\\n0.65 or 0.75 to 0.90 as ϵt increases from the compression-controlled limit to 0.005. In\\nthis regard, the reader is again referred to Figure 3.5 in Chapter 3 where the transition\\nzone and the variation ofφ values are clearly shown. This topic is continued in Section\\n10.10.\\n(c) As described in Chapter 9, maximum permissible column loads were speciﬁed for\\ncolumns no matter how small their e values. As a result, the upper part of each design\\ninteraction curve is shown as a horizontal line representing the appropriate value of\\nPu = φPn max for tied columns = 0.80φ[0.85f ′\\nc (Ag − Ast ) + fyAst ]\\n(ACI Equation 10-2)\\nPu = φPn max for spiral columns = 0.85φ[0.85f ′\\nc(Ag − Ast ) + fyAst ]\\n(ACI Equation 10-1)\\nThese formulas were developed to be approximately equivalent to loads applied with\\neccentricities of 0.10 h for tied columns and 0.05 h for spiral columns.\\nEach of the three modiﬁcations described here is indicated on the design curve of\\nFigure 10.13.

The result would\\nbe an astronomical number of diagrams. The number can be tremendously reduced, however,\\nif the diagrams are plotted with ordinates of Kn = Pn /f ′\\ncAg (instead of Pn) and with abscissas\\nof Rn = Pn e/f ′\\ncAg h (instead of Mn). The resulting normalized interaction diagrams can be\\nused for cross sections with widely varying dimensions. The ACI has prepared normalized\\ninteraction curves in this manner for the different cross section and bar arrangement situations\\nshown in Figure 10.14 and for different grades of steel and concrete. 3\\nTwo of the ACI diagrams are given in Figures 10.15 and 10.16, while Appendix A\\n(Graphs 2 to 13) presents several other ones for the situations given in parts (a), (b), and (d) of\\nFigure 10.14. Notice that these ACI d iagrams do not include the three modiﬁcations described\\nin the last section.\\nThe ACI column interaction diagrams are used in Examples 10.3 to 10.7 to design or\\nanalyze columns for different situations.

If we plot on the interaction\\ndiagram the intersection point of Kn and Rn for a particular column and draw a straight line\\nfrom that point to the lower-left corner or origin of the ﬁgure, we will have a line with a\\nconstante/h. For the column of Example 10.6, e/h = 10 in./20 in. = 0.5. Therefore, a line\\nis plotted from the origin through a set of assumed values for Kn and Rn in the proportion\\nof 10 /20 to each other. In this case, Kn was set equal to 0.8 and Rn = 0.5 × 0.8 = 0.4.\\nNext, a line was drawn from that intersection point to the origin of the diagram, as shown\\nin Figure 10.16.

The value of Nu/Ag is the average factored\\naxial stress in the column and is expressed in units of psi. Should Vu be greater than φVc/2, it\\nwill be necessary to calculate required tie spacing using the stirrup spacing procedures described\\nin Chapter 8. The results will be closer tie spacing than required by the usual column rules\\ndiscussed earlier in Section 9.5.\\nSections 11.2.3 and 11.4.7.3 of the ACI Code specify the method for calculating the\\ncontribution of the concrete to the total shear strength of circular columns and for calculating\\nthe contribution of shear reinforcement for cases where circular hoops, ties, or spirals are\\npresent. According to the commentary of the code in Section 11.2.3, the entire cross section\\nin circular columns is effective in resisting shearing forces. The shear area,bwd,i nA C I\\nEquation 11-4 then would be equal to the gross area of the column. However, to provide for\\ncompatibility with other calculations requiring an effective depth, the ACI requires that, when\\napplied to circular columns, the shear area in ACI Equation 11-4 be computed as an equivalent\\nrectangular area in which\\nbw = D\\nd = 0.8D\\nIn these equations, D is the gross diameter of the column. If the constant modifying D in\\nthe effective depth equation were equal to π/4, which is equal to 0.7854, the effective rect-\\nangular area would be equal to the gross area of the circular column. Thus, the area of the\\ncolumn is overestimated by a little less than 2% when using the equivalent area prescribed by\\nthe ACI.\\n10.8 Biaxial Bending\\nMany columns are subjected to biaxial bending, that is, bending about both axes. Corner\\ncolumns in buildings where beams and girders frame into the columns from both directions are\\nthe most common cases, but there are others, such as where columns are cast monolithically\\nas part of frames in both directions or where columns are supporting heavy spandrel beams.\\nBridge piers are almost always subject to biaxial bending.\\nCircular columns have polar symmetry and, thus, the same ultimate capacity in all direc-\\ntions. The design process is the same, therefore, regardless of the directions of the moments.\\nIf there is bending about both the x-a n d y-axes, the biaxial moment can be computed by\\ncombining the two moments or their eccentric ities as follows:\\nMu =\\n√\\n(Mux )2 + (Muy )2'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 322}, page_content=\"McCormac c10.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:47 P.M.

Whenever possible, it is desirable to make columns subject to biaxial bend-\\ning circular in shape. Should it be n ecessary to use square or rectangular columns for such\\ncases, the reinforcing should be pl aced uniformly ar ound the perimeters.\\nYou might quite logically think that you could determine Pn for a biaxially loaded\\ncolumn by using static equations, as was done in Example 10.2. Such a procedure will lead\\nto the correct answer, but the mathematics involved is so complicated because of the shape of\\nthe compression side of the column that the method is not a practical one. Nevertheless, a few\\ncomments are made about this type of solution, and reference is made to Figure 10.21.\\nAn assumed location is selected for the neutral axis, and the appropriate strain triangles\\nare drawn, as shown in Figure 10.21. The usual equations are written with Cc = 0.85f ′\\nc times\\nthe shaded area Ac and with each bar having a force equal to its cross-sectional area times its\\nstress. The solution of the equation yields the load that would establish that neutral axis—but\\nthe designer usually starts with certain loads and eccentricities and does not know the neutral\\naxis location. Furthermore, the neutral axis is probably not even perpendicular to the resultant\\ne =\\n√\\n(ex )2 + (ey )2.\\nFor column shapes other than circular ones, it is desirable to consider three-dimensional\\ninteraction curves such as the one shown in Figure 10.22. In this ﬁgure, the curve labeled Mnxo\\nrepresents the interaction curve if bending occurs about the x-axis only, while the one labeled\\nMnyo is the one if bending occurs about the y-axis only.\\nIn this ﬁgure, for a constant Pn, the hatched plane shown represents the contour of Mn\\nfor bending about any axis.\\nToday, the analysis of columns subject to biaxial bending is primarily done with com-\\nputers.

The average designer will not want\\nto spend the time necessary to make these calculations and will either just use the smaller φ\\nvalues or make use of a computer program, such as the Excel spreadsheet provided for this\\nchapter. This program uses a routine for computing ϵt and φ for columns.\\nThe procedure described here can be used to make a long-hand determination of ϵt.A s\\na beginning, we assume c/dt = 0.60 where ϵt = 0.002 (assumed yield strain for Grade 60\\nreinforcement), as shown in Figure 10.25. With this value, we can calculate c, a, ϵc, ϵt, fs,\\nand f ′\\nc for our column.

If the ϵt of our column falls between the two\\nϵt values we have just calculated, the column falls in the transition zone for φ. To determine its\\nvalue, we can try different c/dt values between 0.600 and 0.375 until the calculated ϵt equals\\nthe actual ϵt of the column.\\nIf you go through this process one time, you will probably have seen all you want to see\\nof it and will no doubt welcome the fact that the Excel spreadsheet provided for this textbook\\ncan be used to determine the value of φ for a particular column.\\nWhen using the interaction diagrams in Appendix A, it is easy to see the region where\\nthe variable φ factor applies.

Page 317\\nCHAPTER 1 1\\nSlender Columns\\n11.1 Introduction\\nWhen a column bends or deﬂects laterally an amount /Delta1, its axial load will cause an increased\\ncolumn moment equal to P/Delta1. This moment will be superimposed onto any moments already\\nin the column. Should this P/Delta1moment be of such magnitude as to reduce the axial load\\ncapacity of the column signiﬁcantly, the column will be referred to as a slender column.\\nSection 10.10.2 of the code states that the design of a compression member should,\\ndesirably, be based on a theoretical analysis of the structure that takes into account the effects of\\naxial loads, moments, deﬂections, duration of loads, varying member sizes, end conditions, and\\nso on. If such a theoretical procedure is not used, the code (10.10.5) provides an approximate\\nmethod for determining slenderness effects. This method, which is based on the factors just\\nmentioned for an “exact” analysis, results in a moment magniﬁer,δ, which is to be multiplied\\nby the larger moment at the end of the column denoted as M2, and that value is used in design.\\nIf bending occurs about both axes, δ is to be computed separately for each direction and the\\nvalues obtained multiplied by the respective moment values.\\n11.2 Nonsway and Sway Frames\\nFor this discussion, it is necessary to distinguish between frames without sidesway and those\\nwith sidesway. In the ACI Code, these are referred to respectively asnonsway frames and sway\\nframes.\\nFor the building story in question, the columns in nonsway frames must be designed\\naccording to Section 10.10.6 of the code, while the columns of sway frames must be designed\\naccording to Section 10.10.7. As a result, it is ﬁrst necessary to decide whether we have\\na nonsway frame or a sway frame.You must real ize that you w ill rarely ﬁnd a frame that\\nis completely braced aga inst sway ing or one that is completely unbraced aga inst sway ing.\\nTherefore, you are going to have to dec ide which way to handle it.\\nThe question may possibly be resolved by examining the lateral stiffness of the bracing\\nelements for the story in question. You may observe that a particular column is located in\\na story where there is such substantial lateral stiffness provided by bracing members, shear\\nwalls, shear trusses, and so on that any lateral deﬂections occurring will be too small to affect\\nthe strength of the column appreciably. You should realize that, while examining a particular\\nstructure, there may be some nonsway stories and some sway stories.\\nIf we cannot tell by inspection whether we have a nonsway frame or a sway frame, the\\ncode provides two ways of making a decision. First, in ACI Section 10.10.5.1, a story in a\\nframe is said to be a nonsway one if the increase in column end moments from second-order\\neffects is 5% or less of the ﬁrst-order end moments.\\nThe second method for determining whether a particular frame is braced or unbraced is\\ngiven in the code (10.10.5.2). If the value of the so-called stability index (which follows) is\\n≤ 0.05, the commentary states that the frame may be classiﬁed as a nonsway one. (Should Vu\\nbe equal to zero, this method will not apply.)\\n317'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 337}, page_content='McCormac c11.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:56 P.M.

For the average-size reinforced concrete building,\\nload eccentricities and slenderness values will be small, and frames will be considered to be\\nbraced. Certainly, however, it isw ise in questionable cases to err on the s ide of the unbraced .\\n11.3 Slenderness Effects\\nThe slenderness of columns is based on their geometry and on their lateral bracing. As their\\nslenderness increases, their bending stresses increase, and thus buckling may occur. Reinforced\\nconcrete columns generally have small slenderness ratios. As a result, they can usually be\\ndesigned as short columns without strength reductions b ecause of slenderness. If slenderness\\neffects are considered small, then columns can be considered “short” and can be designed\\naccording to Chapter 10. However, if they are “slender,” the moment for which the column\\nmust be designed is increased or magniﬁed. Once the moment is magniﬁed, the column is then\\ndesigned according to Chapter 10 using the increased moment.\\nSeveral items involved in the calculation of slenderness ratios are discussed in the next\\nseveral paragraphs. These include unsupported column lengths, effective length factors, radii\\nof gyration, and the ACI Code requirements. The ACI Code (10.10.2.1) limits second-order\\neffects to not more than 40% of ﬁrst-order effects.\\nUnsupported Lengths\\nThe length used for calculating the slenderness ratio of a column, lu , is its unsupported length.\\nThis length is considered to be equal to the clear distance between slabs, beams, or other\\nmembers that provide lateral support to the column. If haunches or capitals (see Figure 16.1\\nin Chapter 16) are present, the clear distance is measured from the bottoms of the capitals or\\nhaunches.\\nEffective Length Factors\\nTo calculate the slenderness ratio of a particular column, it is necessary to estimate its effective\\nlength. This is the distance between points of zero moment in the column. For this initial\\ndiscussion, it is assumed that no sidesway or joint translation is possible. Sidesway or joint\\ntranslation means that one or both ends of a column can move laterally with respect to each\\nother.\\nIf there were such a thing as a perfectly pinned end column, its effective length would be\\nits unsupported length, as shown in Figure 11.1(a). The effective length factor, k, is the number\\nthat must be multiplied by the column’s unsupported length to obtain its effective length.

Page 320\\n320 CHAPTER 1 1 Slender Columns\\nColumns with different end conditions have entirely different effective lengths. For\\ninstance, if there were such a thing as a perfectly ﬁxed end column, its points of inﬂec-\\ntion (or points of zero moment) would occur at its one-fourth points, and its effective length\\nwould belu /2, as shown in Figure 11.1(b). As a result, its k value would equal 0.5.\\nObviously, the smaller the effective length of a particular column, the smaller its danger\\nof buckling and the greater its load-carrying capacity. Figure 11.1(c) shows a column with one\\nend ﬁxed and one end pinned. Thek factor for this column is approximately 0.70.\\nThe concept of effective lengths is simply a mathematical method of taking a\\ncolumn—whatever its end and bracing conditions—and replacing it with an equivalent\\npinned end-braced column. A complex buckling analysis could be made for a frame to\\ndetermine the critical stress in a particular column. Thek factor is determined by ﬁnding\\nthe pinned end column with an equivalent length that provides the same critical stress. The\\nk factor procedure is a method of making simple solutions for complicated frame-buckling\\nproblems.\\nReinforced concrete columns serve as parts of frames, and these frames are sometimes\\nbraced and sometimes unbraced. A braced frame is one for which sidesway or joint translation\\nis prevented by means of bracing, shear walls, or lateral support from adjoining structures. An\\nunbraced frame does not have any of these types of bracing s upplied and must depend on\\nthe stiffness of its own members to prevent lateral buckling. For braced frames, k values can\\nnever be greater than 1.0, but for unbr aced frames, the k values will always be greater than\\n1.0 because of sidesway.\\nAn example of an unbraced column is shown in Figure 11.2(a). The base of this particular\\ncolumn is assumed to be ﬁxed, whereas its upper end is assumed to be completely free to both\\nrotate and translate. The elastic curve of such a column will take the shape of the elastic curve\\nof a pinned-end column of twice its length. Its effective length will therefore equal 2lu ,a s\\nshown in the ﬁgure. In Figure 11.2(b), another unbr aced column case is illustrated. The bottom\\nof this column is connected to beams that provide resistance to rotation but not enough to be\\nconsidered a ﬁxed end. In most buildings, partial rotational restraint is common, not pinned or\\nﬁxed ends. Section 11.4 shows how to evaluate such partial restraint. For the case shown in\\nFigure 11.2(b), if the beam at the bottom is ﬂexible compared with the column, the k factor\\napproaches inﬁnity. If it is very stiff, k approaches 2.\\nThe code (10.10.6.3) states that the effective length factor is to be taken as 1.0 for\\ncompression members in frames braced against sidesway unless a theoretical analysis shows\\nk`u = 2`u k`u > 2`u\\n`u\\n`u\\n(a) Upper end free to rotate and\\n translate, lower end fixed\\n(b) Upper end free to rotate and\\n translate, lower end partially\\n restrained against rotation\\nFIGURE 1 1 . 2 Columns for unbraced frames.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 340}, page_content='McCormac c11.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:56 P.M. Page 321\\n11.4 Determining k Factors with Alignment Charts 321\\nthat a lesser value can be used. Should the member be in a frame not br aced against sidesway,\\nthe value of k will be larger than 1.0 and must be determined with proper consideration given\\nto the effects of cracking and reinforcing on the column stiffness. ACI-ASCE Committee 441\\nsuggests that it is not realistic to assume that k will be less than 1.2 for such columns; therefore,\\nit seems logical to make preliminary designs with k equal to or larger than that value.\\n11.4 Determining k Factors with Alignment Charts\\nThe preliminary procedure used for estimating effective lengths involves the use of the align-\\nment charts shown in Figure 11.3. 1,2 Before computerized analysis, use of such alignment\\ncharts was the traditional method for determining effective lengths of columns. The chart of\\npart (a) of the ﬁgure is applicable to braced frames, whereas the one of part (b) is applicable\\nto unbraced frames.\\nTo use the alignment charts for a particular column, ψ factors are computed at each\\nend of the column. The ψ factor at one end of the column equals the sum of the stiffness\\n[/Sigma1(EI/l)] of the columns meeting at that joint, including the column in question, divided by\\nthe sum of all the stiffnesses of the beams meeting at the joint. Should one end of the column\\nbe pinned, ψ is theoretically equal to ∞,a n di fﬁ x e d ,ψ = 0. Since a perfectly ﬁxed end is\\npractically impossible to have, ψ is usually taken as 1.0 instead of 0 for assumed ﬁxed ends.\\nWhen column ends are supported by, but not rigidly connected to a footing, ψ is theoretically\\ninﬁnity but usually is taken as about 10 for practical design.\\nOne of the two ψ values is called ψA and the other is called ψB . After these values are\\ncomputed, the effective length factor, k, is obtained by placing a straightedge between ψA and\\nψB . The point where the straightedge crosses the middle nomograph is k.\\nIt can be seen that the ψ factors used to enter the alignment charts, and thus the resulting\\neffective length factors, are dependent on the relative stiffnesses of the compression and ﬂexural\\nmembers. If we have a very light ﬂexible column and large stiff girders, the rotation and lateral\\nmovement of the column ends will be greatly minimized. The column ends will be close to\\na ﬁxed condition, and thus theψ values and the resulting k values will be small. Obviously,\\nif the reverse happens—that is, large stiff columns framing into light ﬂexible girders—the\\ncolumn ends will rotate almost freely, approaching a pinned condition. Consequently, we will\\nhave largeψ and k values.\\nTo calculate the ψ values, it is necessary to use realistic moments of inertia. Usually the\\ngirders will be appreciably cracked on their tensile sides, whereas the columns will probably\\nhave only a few cracks. If theI values for the girders are underestimated a little, the column\\nk factors will be a little large and thus on the safe side.\\nSeveral approximate rules are in use for estimating beam and column rigidities. One\\ncommon practice of the past for slenderness ratios of up to about 60 or 70 was to use gross\\nmoments of inertia for the columns and 50% of the gross moments of inertia for the beams.\\nIn ACI Section 10.10.4.1, it is stated that for determining ψ values for use in evaluating\\nk factors, the rigidity of the beams may be calculated on the basis of 0.35 Ig to account for\\ncracking and reinforcement, while 0.70Ig may be used for compression members. This practice\\nis followed for the examples in this chapter. Other values for the estimated rigidity of walls\\nand ﬂat plates are provided in the same section.\\n1 Structural Stability Research Council, Guide to Stab ility Design Criteria for Metal Structures , 4th ed., T.

The code (10.10.4.1) allows these values to be only\\nwithin 10% of the ﬁnal values in the ﬁnal iteration.\\n11.7 Slender Columns in Nonsway and Sway Frames\\nThere is a major difference in the behavior of columns in nonsway or br aced frames and those\\nin sway or unbr aced frames. In effect, each column in a braced frame acts by itself. In other\\nwords, its individual strength can be determined and compared to its computed factored loads\\nand moments. In an unbr aced or sway frame, a column will probably not buckle individually\\nbut will probably buckle simultaneously with all of the other columns on the same level. As a\\nresult, it is necessary in a sway frame to consider the buckling strength of all the columns on\\nthe level in question as a unit.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 344}, page_content='McCormac c11.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:56 P.M. Page 325\\n11.7 Slender Columns in Nonsway and Sway Frames 325\\nFor a compression member in a nonsway frame, the effective slenderness ratio, klu /r,\\nis used to determine whether the member is short or slender. For this calculation, lu is the\\nunbraced length of the member. The effective length factor, k, can be taken as 1.0 unless an\\nanalysis provides a lesser value. The radius of gyration, r, is equal to 0.25 times the diameter\\nof a round column and 0.289 times the dimension of a rectangular column in the direction that\\nstability is being considered. The ACI Code (10.10.1.2) permits the approximate value of 0.30\\nto be used in place of 0.289, and this is done herein. For other sections, the value ofr will\\nhave to be computed from the properties of the gross sections.\\nFor nonsway frames, slenderness effects may be ignored if the following expression is\\nsatisﬁed: klu\\nr ≤ 34 − 12\\n(M1\\nM2\\n⎡\\n(ACI Equation 10-7)\\nIn this expression, M1 is the smaller factored end moment in a compression member. It\\nhas a plus sign if the member is bent in single curvature (C shaped) and a negative sign if the\\nmember is bent in double curvature (S shaped). M2 is the larger factored end moment in a com-\\npression member, and it always has a plus sign. In this equation, the term\\n[\\n34 − 12\\n(\\nM1/M2\\n⎡]\\nshall not be taken larger than 40, according to ACI Code 10.10.1\\nFor sway frames, slenderness effects may be ignored if\\nklu\\nr < 22 (ACI Equation 10-6)\\nShould klu /r for a particular column be larger than the applicable ratio, we will have a\\nslender column. For such a column, the effect of slenderness must be considered. This may be\\ndone by using approximate methods or by using a theoretical second-order analysis that takes\\ninto account the effect of deﬂections. Second-order effects cannot ex ceed 40% of ﬁrst-order\\neffects (ACI 10.10.2.1).\\nA second-order analysis is one that takes into account the effect of deﬂections and also\\nmakes use of a reduced tangent modulus. The equations n ecessary for designing a column in\\nthis range are extremely complicated, and, practically, it is necessary to use column design\\ncharts or computer programs.\\nAvoiding Slender Columns\\nThe design of slender columns is appreciably more complicated than the design of short\\ncolumns. As a result, it may be wise to give some consideration to the use of certain minimum\\ndimensions so that none of the columns will be slender. In this way, they can be almost\\ncompletely avoided in the average-size building.\\nIf k is assumed equal to 1.0, slenderness can usually be neglected in braced frame\\ncolumns, if lu /h is kept to 10 or less on the ﬁrst ﬂoor and 14 or less for the ﬂoors above the\\nﬁrst one. To determine these values, it was assumed that little moment resistance was provided\\nat the footing–column connection and the ﬁrst-ﬂoor columns were assumed to be bent in single\\ncurvature. Should the footing–column connection be designed to have appreciable moment\\nresistance, the maximumlu /h value given above as 10 should be raised to about 14 or equal\\nto the value used for the upper ﬂoors. 4\\nShould we have an unbr aced frame and assume k = 1.2, it is probably n ecessary to keep\\nlu /h to 6 or less. So for a 10-ft clear ﬂoor height, it is n ecessary to use a minimum h of about\\n10 ft/6 = 1.67 ft = 20 in. in the direction of bending to avoid slender columns.\\n4 Neville, G.

Page 328\\n328 CHAPTER 1 1 Slender Columns\\n11.8 ACI Code Treatments of Slenderness Effects\\nThe ACI Code permits the determination of second-order effects by one of three methods. The\\nﬁrst is by a nonlinear second-order analys is (ACI 10.10.3). Such an analysis must consider\\nnonlinearity of materials, member curvature and lateral drift, load duration, volume changes\\nin concrete because of creep and shrinkage, and foundation or support interaction. The anal-\\nysis technique should predict the ultimate loads to within 15% or test results on statically\\nindeterminate reinforced concrete structures. This technique would require sophisticated com-\\nputer software that has been demonstrated to satisfy the 15% accuracy requirement mentioned\\npreviously.\\nThe second method is by an elastic second-order analys is (ACI 10.10.4). This tech-\\nnique is simpler than the nonlinear method because it uses member stiffnesses immediately\\nprior to failure. V alues ofEc and moments of inertia and cross-sectional area for columns,\\nbeams, walls, ﬂat plates, and ﬂat slabs that are permitted to be used in the elastic second-order\\nanalysis are listed in Section 11.6. This method would also most likely require a computer\\nanalysis.\\nThe third method is the moment magniﬁer procedure (ACI 10.10.5). Different procedures\\nfor this method are given for sway and nonsway structures. The next two sections describe the\\nmoment magniﬁer method for these two cases.\\n11.9 Magniﬁcation of Column Moments in\\nNonsway Frames\\nWhen a column is subjected to moment along its unbr aced length, it will be displaced laterally\\nin the plane of bending. The result will be an increased or secondary moment equal to the\\naxial load times the lateral displacement or eccentricity. In Figure 11.5, the loadP causes the\\ncolumn moment to be increased by an amount P/Delta1. This moment will cause δ to increase a\\nlittle more, with the result that the P/Delta1moment will increase, which in turn will cause a further\\nincrease in /Delta1and so on until equilibrium is r eached.\\nWe could take the column moments, compute the lateral deﬂection, increase the moment\\nby P/Delta1, recalculate the lateral deﬂection and the increased moment, and so on. Alt hough about\\ntwo cycles would be sufﬁcient, this would still be a tedious and impractical procedure.\\nFIGURE 1 1 . 5 Moment magniﬁcation in a nonsway column.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 348}, page_content='McCormac c11.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:56 P.M.

It will be noted that in this problem, the primary moment of 75 ft-k is estimated\\nto increase by 7.4 ft-k. If we computed the deﬂection from the lateral load, we would get\\n0.445 in. For this value, P/Delta1= (150)(0.445) = 66.75 in-k = 5.6 ft-k.

The two expressions given for EI in the code were\\ndeveloped so as to account for creep, cracks, and so on.

For some moment situations in columns, the ampliﬁcation or moment magniﬁer expres-\\nsion provides moments that are too large. One such situation occurs when the moment\\nat one end of the member is zero. For this situation, the lateral deﬂection is actually\\nabout half of the deﬂection in effect provided by the ampliﬁcation factor.

This signiﬁcant reduction occurs b ecause of the\\nincreased φ factor in this region.\\nMost columns are designed for multiple load combinations, and the designer must be\\ncertain that the column is able to resist all of them. Often there are some columns with high\\naxial load and low moment, such as 1.2 D + 1.6L, and others with low axial load and high\\nmoment, such as 0.9 D + 1.6E. The ﬁrst of these is likely to have a φ factor of 0.65. The\\nsecond, however, is more likely to be eligible for the increase in the φ factor.\\nIn this example, the authors assumed that the frame was braced, and yet we have said\\nthat frames are often in that gray area between being fully braced and fully unbraced. Assuming\\naf r a m eis fully braced clearly may be qu ite unconservative.\\n11.10 Magniﬁcation of Column Moments in Sway Frames\\nTests have shown that even though the lateral deﬂections in unbr aced frames are rather small,\\ntheir buckling loads are far less than they would be if the frames had been braced. As a\\nresult, the buckling strengths of the columns of an unbraced frame can be decidedly increased\\n(perhaps by as much as two or three times) by providing bracing.\\nIf a frame is unbr aced against sidesway, it is ﬁrst necessary to compute its slenderness\\nratio. If klu /r is less than 22, slenderness may be neglected (ACI 10.10.1). For this discussion,\\nit is assumed that values greater than 22 are obtained.\\nWhen sway frames are involved, it is n ecessary to decide for each load combination\\nwhich of the loads cause appreciable sidesway (probably the lateral loads) and which do not.\\nThe factored end moments that cause sidesway are referred to asM1s and M2s ,a n dt h e ym u s t'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 353}, page_content='McCormac c11.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:56 P.M.

They are determined by ﬁrst-order analysis\\nand will not have to be magniﬁed.\\nThe code (10.10.7) states that the moment magniﬁer, δs , can be determined by one of\\nthe following two methods.\\n1. The moment magniﬁer may be calculated with the equation given at the end of this\\nparagraph in which Q is the stability index previously presented in Section 11.2 of this\\nchapter. Should the computed value of δs be greater than 1.5, it will be necessary to\\ncompute δs by ACI Section 10.10.7.4 or by a second-order analysis.\\nδs = 1\\n1 − Q ≥ 1 (ACI Equation 10-20)\\n2. With the second method and the one used in this chapter, the magniﬁed sway moments\\nmay be computed with the following expression:\\nδs = 1\\n1 − /Sigma1Pu\\n0.75/Sigma1Pc\\n≥ 1 (ACI Equation 10-21)\\nIn this last equation, /Sigma1Pu is the summation of all the vertical loads in the story in\\nquestion, and /Sigma1Pc is the sum of all the Euler buckling loads, Pc = π2EI /(klu )2,f o ra l lo f\\nthe sway-resisting columns in the story with k values determined as described in ACI Section\\n10.10.7.2. This formula reﬂects the fact that the lateral deﬂections of all the columns in a\\nparticular story are equal, and thus the columns are interactive.\\nWhichever of the preceding met hods is used to determine the δs values, the design\\nmoments to be used must be calculated with the expressions that follow.\\nM1 = M1ns + δs M1s (ACI Equation 10-18)\\nM2 = M2ns + δs M2s (ACI Equation 10-19)\\n©asterix0597/iStockphoto.\\nReinforced concrete columns and shearwalls supporting structural steel roof.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 354}, page_content='McCormac c11.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 9:56 P.M.

The effect of creep is accounted for in design by reducing the stiffness\\nEI used to calculate Pc and thus δs by dividing EI by 1 + βdns , as speciﬁed in ACI Section\\n10.10.6.1. Both the concrete and steel terms in ACI Equation 10-14 are divided by this value. In\\nthe case of sustained lateral load, such as soil backﬁll or water pressure, ACI Section 10.10.4.2\\nrequires that the moments of inertia for compression members in Section 11.6 be divided by\\n(1 + βds ).T h et e r mβds is the ratio of the maximum factored sustained shear within a story to\\nthe maximum factored shear in that story for the same load combination.\\nTo illustrate the computation of the magniﬁed moments needed for the design of a slender\\ncolumn in a sway frame, the authors have chosen the simple frame of Figure 11.9. We hope\\nthereby that the student will not become lost in a forest of numbers, as he or she might if a\\nlarge frame were considered.\\nThe beam and columns of the frame have been tentatively sized, as shown in the ﬁgure.\\nIn Example 11.5, the frame is analyzed for each of the c onditions speciﬁed in ACI Section 9.2\\nusing 1.0W.\\nIn the example, the magniﬁcation factors δ and δs are computed for each of the loading\\nconditions and used to compute the magniﬁed moments. Notice in the solution that different\\nkvalues are used for determining δ and δs .T h e k for the δ calculation is determined from the\\nalignment chart of Figure 11.3(a) for braced frames, whereas the k for the δs calculation is\\ndetermined from the alignment chart of Figure 11.3(b) for unbr aced frames.\\nExample 11.5\\nDetermine the moments and axial forces that must be used for the design of column CD of the\\nunbraced frame of Figure 11.9.

Page 347\\nCHAPTER 1 2\\nFootings\\n12.1 Introduction\\nFootings are structural members used to support columns and walls and transmit their loads\\nto the underlying soils. Reinforced concrete is a material admirably suited for footings and is\\nused as such for both reinforced concrete and structural steel buildings, bridges, towers, and\\nother structures.\\nThe permissible pressure on a soil beneath a footing is normally a few tons per square\\nfoot. The compressive stresses in the walls and columns of an ordinary structure may run as\\nhigh as a few hundred tons per square foot. It is, therefore, necessary to spread these loads\\nover sufﬁcient soil areas to permit the soil to support the loads safely.\\nNot only is it desired to transfer the superstructure loads to the soil beneath in a manner\\nthat will prevent excessive or uneven settlements and rotations, but it is also n ecessary to\\nprovide sufﬁcient resistance to sliding and overturning.\\nTo accomplish these objectives, it is necessary to transmit the s upported loads to a soil\\nof sufﬁcient strength and then to spread them out over an area such that the unit pressure is\\nwithin a reasonable range. If it is not possible to dig a short distance and ﬁnd a satisfactory\\nsoil, it will be necessary to use piles or caissons to do the job. These latter subjects are not\\nconsidered within the scope of this text.\\nThe closer a foundation is to the ground surf ace, the more ec onomical it will be to\\nconstruct. There are two reasons, however, that may keep the designer from using very shallow\\nfoundations. First, it is n ecessary to locate the bottom of a footing below the ground fr eezing\\nlevel to avoid vertical movement or heaving of the footing as the soil freezes and expands in\\nvolume. This depth varies from about 3 ft to 6 ft in the northern states and less in the southern\\nstates. Second, it is necessary to excavate a sufﬁcient distance so that a satisfactory bearing\\nmaterial is reached, and this distance may on occasion be quite a few feet.\\n12.2 Types of Footings\\nAmong the several types of reinforced concrete footings in common use are the wall, isolated,\\ncombined, raft, and pile-cap types. These are brieﬂy introduced in this section; the remainder\\nof the chapter is used to provide more detailed information about the simpler types of this\\ngroup.\\n1. A wall footing, as shown in Figure 12.1(a), is simply an enlargement of the bottom of\\na wall that will sufﬁciently distribute the load to the foundation soil. Wall footings are\\nnormally used around the perimeter of a building and perhaps for some of the interior\\nwalls.\\n2. An isolated or single-column footing, as shown in Figure 12.1(b), is used to support the\\nload of a single column. These are the most commonly used footings, particularly where\\nthe loads are relatively light and the columns are not closely spaced.\\n347'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 367}, page_content='McCormac c12.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:16 P.M.

Combined footings are used to support two or more column loads, Figure 12.1(c). A\\ncombined footing might be economical where two or more heavily loaded columns are\\nso spaced that normally designed single-column footings would run into each other.\\nSingle-column footings are usually square or rectangular and, when used for columns\\nlocated right at property lines, extend across those lines. A footing for such a column\\ncombined with one for an interior column can be designed to ﬁt within the property\\nlines.\\n4. A mat or raft or ﬂoat ing foundation, Figure 12.1(d), is a continuous reinforced concrete\\nslab over a large area used to support many columns and walls. This kind of foundation\\nis used where soil strength is low or where column loads are large but where piles\\nor caissons are not used. For such cases, isolated footings would be so large that it\\nis more economical to use a continuous raft or mat under the entire area. The cost of\\nthe formwork for a mat footing is far less than is the cost of the forms for a large\\nnumber of isolated footings. If individual footings are designed for each column and\\nif their combined area is greater than half of the area contained within the perimeter\\nof the building, it is usually more economical to use one large footing or mat. The\\nraft or mat foundation is particularly useful in reducing differential settlements between\\ncolumns—the reduction being 50% or more. For these types of footings, the excavations\\nare often rather deep. The goal is to remove an amount of earth approximately equal to\\nthe building weight. If this is done, the net soil pressure after the building is constructed\\nwill theoretically equal what it was before the excavation was made. Thus, the building\\nwill ﬂoat on the raft foundation.\\n5.

Page 350\\n350 CHAPTER 1 2 Footings\\n12.3 Actual Soil Pressures\\nThe soil pressure at the surface of contact between a footing and the soil is assumed to be\\nuniformly distributed as long as the load above is applied at the center of gravity of the footing,\\nFigure 12.2(a). This assumption is made even though many tests have shown that soil pressures\\nare unevenly distributed due to variations in soil properties, footing rigidity, and other factors.\\nAs an example of the variation of soil pressures, footings on sand and clay soils are\\nconsidered. When footings are supported by sandy soils, the pressures are larger under the\\ncenter of the footing and smaller near the edge, Figure 12.2(b). The sand at the edges of the\\nfooting does not have a great deal of lateral support and tends to move from underneath the\\nfooting edges, with the result that more of the load is carried near the center of the footing.\\nShould the bottom of a footing be located at some distance from the ground surf ace, a sandy\\nsoil will provide fairly uniform support b ecause it is restrained from lateral movement.\\nassumed condition\\n(uniform pressure)\\nsandy soil\\nclayey soil\\n(c)\\n(b)\\n(a)\\nFIGURE 1 2 . 2 Soil cond itions.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 370}, page_content='McCormac c12.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:16 P.M. Page 351\\n12.4 Allowable Soil Pressures 351\\nJust the opposite situation is true for footings supported by clayey soils. The clay under\\nthe edges of the footing sticks to or has cohesion with the surrounding clay soil. As a result,\\nmore of the load is carried at the edge of the footing than near the middle [see Figure 12.2(c)].\\nThe designer should clearly understand that the assumption of uniform soil pressure\\nunderneath footings is made for reasons of simplifying calculations and may very well have\\nto be revised for some soil conditions.\\nShould the load be eccentrically applied to a footing with respect to the center of gravity\\nof the footing, the soil pressure is assumed to vary uniformly in proportion to the moment, as\\nillustrated in Section 12.12 and Figure 12.23.\\n12.4 Allowable Soil Pressures\\nThe allowable soil pressures to be used for designing the footings for a particular structure are\\npreferably obtained by using the services of a geotechnical engineer. He or she will determine\\nsafe values from the principles of soil mechanics on the basis of test borings, load tests,\\nand other experimental investigations. Other issues may enter into the determination of the\\nallowable soil pressures, such as the sensitivity of the building frame to deﬂection of the\\nfootings. Also, cracking of the superstructure resulting from settlement of the footings would\\nbe much more important in a performing arts center than a warehouse.\\nBecause such investigations often may not be feasible, most building codes provide\\ncertain approximate allowable bearing pressures that can be used for the types of soils and\\nsoil conditions occurring in that locality. Table 12.1 shows a set of allowable values that are\\ntypical of such building codes. It is thought that these values usually provide factors of safety\\nof approximately three against severe settlements.\\nSection 15.2.2 of the ACI Code states that the required area of a footing is to be deter-\\nmined by dividing the anticipated total load, including the footing weight, by a permissible soil\\npressure or permissible pile capacity determined using the principles of soil mechanics. It will\\nbe noted that this total load is theunfactored load, and yet the design of footings described in\\nthis chapter is based on strength design, where the loads are multiplied by the appropriate load\\nTABLE 12. 1 Maximum Allowable Soil Pressure\\nMaximum Allowable Soil Pressure\\nU.S. Customary Units\\n SI Units\\nClass of Material\\n (kips/ft2)\\n (kN/m2)\\n20% of ultimate\\n 20% of ultimate\\nRock\\n crushing strength\\n crushing strength\\nCompact coarse sand, compact ﬁne\\nsand, hard clay, or sand clay\\n 8\\n 385\\nMedium stiff clay or sandy clay\\n 6\\n 290\\nCompact inorganic sand and\\nsilt mixtures\\n 4\\n 190\\nLoose sand\\n 3\\n 145\\nSoft sand clay or clay\\n 2\\n 95\\nLoose inorganic sand–silt mixtures\\n 1\\n 50\\nLoose organic sand–silt mixtures,\\nmuck, or bay mud\\n 0\\n 0\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 371}, page_content='McCormac c12.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:16 P.M. Page 352\\n352 CHAPTER 1 2 Footings\\nfactors. It is obvious that an ultimate load cannot be divided by an allowable soil pressure to\\ndetermine the bearing area required.\\nThe designer can handle this problem in two ways. He or she can determine the bearing\\narea required by summing up the actual or unfactored dead and live loads and dividing them\\nby the allowable soil pressure. Once this area is determined and the dimensions are selected,\\nan ultimate soil pressure can be computed by dividing the factored or ultimate load by the area\\nprovided. The remainder of the footing can then be designed by the strength method using this\\nultimate soil pressure. This simple procedure is used for the footing examples here.\\nThe 1971 ACI Commentary (15.2) provided an alternative method for determining the\\nfooting area required that will give exactly the same answers as the procedure just described. By\\nthis latter method, the allowable soil pressure is increased to an ultimate value by multiplying\\nit by a ratio equal to that used for increasing the magnitude of the service loads. For instance,\\nthe ratio forD and L loads would be\\nRatio = 1.2D + 1.6L\\nD + L\\nOr for D + L + W , and so on\\nRatio = 1.2D + 1.6W + 1.0L + 0.5(Lr or S or R)\\nD + L + W + (Lr or S or R)\\nThe resulting ultimate soil pressure can be divided into the ultimate column load to determine\\nthe area required.\\n12.5 Design of Wall Footings\\nThe theory used for designing beams is applicable to the design of footings with only a few\\nmodiﬁcations. The upward soil pressure under the wall footing of Figure 12.3 tends to bend\\nthe footing into the deformed shape shown. The footings will be designed as shallow beams\\nfor the moments and shears involved. In beams where loads are usually only a few hundred\\npounds per foot and spans are fairly large, sizes are almost always proportioned for moment.\\nIn footings, loads from the supporting soils may run several thousand pounds per foot and\\nspans are relatively short. As a result, shears will almost always control depths.\\nIt appears that the maximum moment in this footing occurs under the middle of the\\nwall, but tests have shown that this is not correct because of the rigidity of such walls. If the\\nwalls are of reinforced concrete with their considerable rigidity, it is considered satisfactory\\nto compute the moments at the faces of the walls (ACI Code 15.4.2). Should a footing be\\nsupporting a masonry wall with its greater ﬂexibility, the code states that the moment should\\nbe taken at a section halfway from the face of the wall to its center. (For a column with a\\nsteel base plate, the critical section for moment is to be located halfway from the face of the\\ncolumn to the edge of the plate.)\\nTo compute the bending moments and shears in a footing, it is necessary to compute\\nonly the net upward pressure, qu , caused by the factored wall loads above. In other words, the\\nweight of the footing and soil on top of the footing can be neglected. These items cause an\\nupward pressure equal to their downward weights, and they cancel each other for purposes of\\ncomputing shears and moments. In a similar manner, it is obvious that there are no moments\\nor shears existing in a book lying ﬂat on a table.\\nShould a wall footing be loaded until it fails in shear, the failure will not occur on a\\nvertical plane at the wall face but rather at an angle of approximately 45 ◦ with the wall, as\\nshown in Figure 12.4. Apparently the diagonal tension, which one would expect to cause cracks\\nin between the two diagonal lines, is opposed by the squ eezing or compression caused by the'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 372}, page_content='McCormac c12.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:16 P.M.

Outside this zone, the compression effect is\\nnegligible in its effect on diagonal tension. Therefore, for nonprestressed sections, shear may\\nbe calculated at a distanced from the face of the wall (ACI Code 11.1.3.1) because of the\\nloads located outside the section.\\nThe use of stirrups in footings is usually considered impractical and uneconomical. For\\nthis reason, the effective depth of wall footings is selected so that Vu is limited to the design\\nshear strength, φVc, that the concrete can carry without web reinforcing, that is, φ2λ\\n√\\nf ′cbw d\\n(from ACI Section 11.3.1.1 and ACI Equation 11-3). Although the equation for Vc contains\\nthe term λ, it would be unusual to use lightweight concrete to construct a footing. The primary\\nadvantage for using lightweight concrete and its associated additional cost is to reduce the\\nweight of the concrete superstructure. It would not be economical to use it in a footing.\\nFIGURE 1 2 . 4 Critical section for shear in a\\nwall footing.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 373}, page_content='McCormac c12.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:16 P.M. Page 354\\n354 CHAPTER 1 2 Footings\\nFor this reason, the term λ will not be included in the example problems for this chapter. The\\nfollowing expression is used to select the depths of wall footings:\\nd = Vu\\n(φ) (2λ\\n√\\nf ′c\\n⎡(bw )\\nor for SI units\\nd = 3Vu\\nφλ\\n√\\nf ′cbw\\nThe design of wall footings is conveniently handled by using 12-in. widths of the\\nwall, as shown in Figure 12.5. Such a practice is followed for the design of a wall footing\\nin Example 12.1. It should be noted that Section 15.7 of the code states that the depth of\\na footing above the bottom reinforcing bars may be no less than 6 in. for footings on soils\\nand 12 in. for those on piles. Thus, total minimum practical depths are at least 10 in. for\\nregular spread footings and 16 in. for pile caps.\\nIn SI units, it is convenient to design wall footings for 1-m-wide sections of the walls.\\nThe depth of such footings above the bottom reinforcing may not be less than 150 mm\\nfor footings on soils or 300 mm for those on piles. As a result, minimum footing depths\\nare at least 250 mm for regular spread footings and 400 mm for pile caps.\\nThe design of a wall footing is illustrated in Example 12.1. Although the example prob-\\nlems and homework problems of this chapter use various f ′\\nc values, 3000 psi and 4000 psi\\nconcretes are commonly used for footings and are generally quite economical. O ccasionally,\\nwhen it is very important to minimize footing depths and weights, stronger concretes may\\nbe used. For most cases, however, the extra cost of higher-strength concrete will apprecia-\\nbly exceed the money saved with the smaller concrete volume. The e xposure category of the\\nfooting may control the concrete strength. ACI Section 4.2 requires that concrete exposed to\\nsulfate have minimum f ′\\nc values of 4000 psi or 4500 psi, depending on the sulfur concentration\\nin the soil.\\nThe determination of a footing depth is a trial-and-error problem. The designer assumes\\nan effective depth, d, computes the d required for shear, tries another d, computes the d required\\nfor shear, and so on, until the assumed value and the calculated value are within about 1 in.\\nof each other.\\nFIGURE 1 2 . 5 One-foot design strip width for wall footing.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 374}, page_content='McCormac c12.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:16 P.M. Page 355\\n12.5 Design of Wall Footings 355\\nYou probably get upset when a footing size is assumed here. You say, “Where in the\\nworld did you get that value?” We think of what seems like a reasonable footing size and start\\nthere. We compute thed required for shear and probably ﬁnd we’ve missed the assumed value\\nquite a bit. We then try another value roughly two-thirds to three-fourths of the way from the\\ntrial value to the computed value (for wall footings) and compute d. (For column footings, we\\nprobably go about halfway from the trial value to the computed value.) Two trials are usually\\nsufﬁcient. We have the advantage over you in that often in preparing the sample problems for\\nthis textbook, we made some scratch-paper trials before arriving at the assumed values used.\\nExample 12.1\\nDesign a wall footing to support a 12-in.-wide reinforced concrete wall with a dead load\\nD = 20 k/ft and a live loadL = 15 k/ft. The bottom of the footing is to be 4 ft below the ﬁnal\\ngrade, the soil weighs 100 lb/ft 3, the allowable soil pressure, qa, is 4 ksf, and there is no\\nappreciable sulfur content in the soil.fy = 60 ksi andf′\\nc = 3 ksi, normal-weight concrete.\\nSOLUTION\\nAssume a 12-in.-thick footing (d = 8.5 in.). The cover is determined by referring to the code (7.7.1),\\nwhich says that for concrete cast against and permanently exposed to the earth, a minimum of\\n3 in. clear distance outside any reinforcing is required. In severe exposure conditions, such as high\\nsulfate concentration in the soil, the cover must be suitably increased (ACI Code Section 7.7.6).\\nThe footing weight is (12 in./12 in/ft) (150 pcf)= 150 psf, and the soil ﬁll on top of the\\nfooting is (36 in./12 in/ft) (100 pcf)= 300 psf.

Such footings\\nare generally square in plan, but they can just as well be rectangular or even circular or\\noctagonal. Rectangular footings are used where such shapes are dictated by the available space\\nor where the cross sections of the columns are very pronounced rectangles.\\nMost footings consist of slabs of constant thickness, such as the one shown in\\nFigure 12.7(a), but if calculated thicknesses are greater than 3 ft or 4 ft, it may be economical\\nto use stepped footings, as illustrated in Figure 12.7(b). The shears and moments in a footing\\nare obviously larger near the column, with the result that greater depths are required in that\\narea as compared to the outer parts of the footing. For very large footings, such as those used\\nfor bridge piers, stepped footings can give appreciable savings in concrete quantities.\\nOccasionally, sloped footings, shown in Figure 12.7(c), are used instead of stepped ones,\\nbut labor costs can be a problem. Whether stepped or sloped, it is considered n ecessary to place\\nthe concrete for the entire footing in a single pour to ensure the construction of a monolithic\\nstructure, thus avoiding horizontal shearing weakness. If this procedure is not followed, it is\\ndesirable to use keys or shear friction reinforcing between the parts to ensure monolithic action.\\nIn addition, when sloped or stepped footings are used, it is necessary to check stresses at more\\nthan one section in the footing. For example, steel area and development length requirements\\nshould be checked at steps as well as at the f aces of walls or columns.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 377}, page_content='McCormac c12.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:16 P.M.

This is done in the paragraphs to follow, while a related\\nsubject, load transfer from columns to footings, is discussed in Section 12.8.\\nShears\\nTwo shear conditions must be considered in column footings, regardless of their shapes. The\\nﬁrst of these is one-way or beam shear, which is the same as that considered in wall footings\\nin the preceding section. For this discussion, reference is made to the footing of Figure 12.8.\\nThe total shear (Vu1 ) to be taken along section 1–1 equals the net soil pressure, qu , times the\\nhatched area outside the section. In the expression to follow, bw is the whole width of the\\nfooting. The maximum value of Vu1 if stirrups are not used equals φVc ,w h i c hi sφ2\\n√\\nf ′cbw d,\\nand the maximum depth required is as follows:\\nd = Vu1\\nφ2\\n√\\nf ′cbw\\n`\\n`\\n2\\na\\nd\\nbw\\na\\nd\\nd\\nd\\nCL\\n2\\n`\\n2\\na\\n2\\nFIGURE 1 2 . 8 One-way or beam shear.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 379}, page_content='McCormac c12.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:16 P.M. Page 360\\n360 CHAPTER 1 2 Footings\\nThe second shear condition is two-way or punching shear (see Figure 12.9). The com-\\npression load from the column tends to spread out into the footing, opposing diagonal tension\\nin that area, with the result that a square column tends to punch out a piece of the slab, which\\nhas the shape of a truncated pyramid. The ACI Code (11.11.1.2) states that the critical section\\nfor two-way shear is located at a distance d/2 from the face of the column.\\nThe shear force, Vu2, consists of all the net upward pressure, qu , on the hatched area\\nshown, that is, on the area outside the part tending to punch out. In the expressions to follow,\\nbo is the perimeter around the punching area, equal to 4 (a + d) in Figure 12.9. The nominal\\ntwo-way shear strength of the concrete, Vc , is speciﬁed as the smallest value obtained by\\nsubstituting into the applicable equations that follow.\\nThe ﬁrst expression is the usual punching shear strength\\nVc = 4λ\\n√\\nf ′cbo d (ACI Equation 11-35)\\nTests have shown that when rectangular footing slabs are subjected to bending in two directions\\nand when the long side of the loaded area is more than two times the length of the short side,\\nthe shear strengthVc = 4λ\\n√\\nf ′cbo d may be much too high.

Page 361\\n12.6 Design of Square Isolated Footings 361\\nThe shear stress in a footing increases as the ratio bo/d decreases. To account for this\\nfact, ACI Equation 11-34 was developed. The equation includes a term αs that is used to\\naccount for variations in the ratio. In applying the equation, αs is to be used as 40 for interior\\ncolumns (where the perimeter is four-sided), 30 for edge columns (where the perimeter is\\nthree-sided), and 20 for corner columns (where the perimeter is two-sided).\\nVc =\\n(αs d\\nbo\\n+ 2\\n⎡\\nλ\\n√\\nf ′cbod (ACI Equation 11-34)\\nThe d required for two-way shear is the largest value obtained from the following\\nexpressions:\\nd = Vu2\\nφ4λ\\n√\\nf ′cbo\\nd = Vu2\\nφ\\n(\\n2 + 4\\nβc\\n⎡\\nλ\\n√\\nf ′cbo\\n(not applicable unless βc is > 2)\\nd = Vu2\\nφ\\n(αs d\\nbo\\n+ 2\\n⎡\\nλ√\\nf ′cbo\\nOr in SI units, with f ′\\nc in MPa and bo and d in mm,\\nd = 6Vu2\\nφλ\\n√\\nf ′cbo\\nd = 6Vu2\\nφ\\n(\\n1 + 8\\nβc\\n⎡\\nλ\\n√\\nf ′cbo\\nd = 12Vu2\\nφ\\n(αs d\\nbo\\n+ 2\\n⎡\\nλ\\n√\\nf ′cbo\\nMoments\\nThe bending moment in a square reinforced concrete footing with a square column is the same\\nabout both axes because of symmetry. If the column is not square, the moment will be larger in\\nthe direction of the shorter column dimension. It should be noted, however, that the effective\\ndepth of the footing cannot be the same in the two directions b ecause the bars in one direction\\nrest on top of the bars in the other direction. The effective depth used for calculations might\\nbe the average for the two directions or, more conservatively, the value for the bars on top.\\nThis lesser value is used for the examples in this text. Although the result is some excess of\\nsteel in one direction, it is felt that the steel in either direction must be sufﬁcient to resist the\\nmoment in that direction. It should be clearly understood that having an excess of steel in one\\ndirection will not make up for a shortage in the other direction at a 90 ◦ angle.\\nThe critical section for bending is taken at the face of a reinforced concrete column or\\nhalfway between the middle and edge of a masonry wall or at a distance halfway from the edge\\nof the base plate and the face of the column if structural steel columns are used (Code 15.4.2).\\nThe determination of footing depths by the procedure described here will often require\\nseveral cycles of a trial-and-error procedure. There are, however, many tables and handbooks'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 381}, page_content='McCormac c12.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:16 P.M.

In addition, there are many rules of thumb used by designers\\nfor making initial thickness estimates, such as 20% of the footing width or the column diameter\\nplus 3 in. Computer programs, such as the spreadsheet provided for this chapter, easily handle\\nthis problem.\\nThe reinforcing steel area calculated for footings will often be appreciably less than\\nthe minimum values (200bw d/fy) and\\n(\\n3\\n√\\nf ′cbw d/fy\\n⎡\\nspeciﬁed for ﬂexural members in ACI\\nSection 10.5.1. In Section 10.5.4, however, the code states that in slabs of uniform thickness,\\nthe minimum area and maximum spacing of reinforcing bars in the direction of bending need\\nonly be equal to those required for shrinkage and temperature reinforcement. The maximum\\nspacing of this reinforcement may not exceed the lesser of three times the footing thickness,\\nor 18 in. Many designers feel that the combination of high shears and lowρ values that often\\noccurs in footings is not a good situation. B ecause of this, they specify steel areas at least\\nas large as the ﬂexural minimums of ACI Section 10.5.1.

The equivalent square\\nis then used for locating the critical sections for moment, shear, and development length.\\n12.8 Load Transfer from Columns to Footings\\nAll forces acting at the base of a column must be satisfactorily transferred into the footing.\\nCompressive forces can be transmitted directly by bearing, whereas uplift or tensile forces\\nmust be transferred to the supporting footing or pedestal by means of developed reinforcing\\nbars or by mechanical connectors (which are often used in precast concrete).\\nA column transfers its load directly to the supporting footing over an area equal to the\\ncross-sectional area of the column. The footing surrounding this contact area, however, supplies\\nappreciable lateral support to the directly loaded part, with the result that the loaded concrete\\nin the footing can support more load. Thus, for the same grade of concrete, the footing can\\ncarry a larger bearing load than can the base of the column.\\nIn checking the strength of the lower part of the column, only the concrete is counted.\\nThe column-reinforcing bars at that point cannot be counted b ecause they are not developed\\nunless dowels are provided or unless the bars themselves are extended into the footing.\\nAt the base of the column, the permitted bearing strength is φ(0.85f ′\\ncA1) (where φ is\\n0.65), but it may be multiplied by\\n√\\nA2/A1 ≤ 2 for bearing on the footing (ACI Code 10.14.1).\\nIn these expressions, A1 is the column area, and A2 is the area of the portion of the supporting\\nfooting that is geometrically similar and concentric with the columns.

Instead of using dowels, it is also possible to increase the size\\nof the column or increase f ′\\nc. Should the computed bearing force be less than the allowable\\nvalue, no dowels or extended reinforcing are theoretically needed, but the code (15.8.2.1) states\\nthat there must be a minimum area of dowels furnished equal to no less than 0.005 times the\\ngross cross-sectional area of the column or pedestal.\\nF I G U R E 12.12Bearing strength area modiﬁcation.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 385}, page_content='McCormac c12.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:16 P.M.

In no case may the area of the designed\\nreinforcement or dowels be less than the area speciﬁed for the case where the allowable\\nbearing force was not exceeded. As a practical matter in placing dowels, it should be noted\\nthat regardless of how small a distance they theoretically need to be extended down into the\\nfooting, they are usually bent at their ends and set on the main footing reinforcing, as shown in\\nFigure 12.13. There the dowels can be tied ﬁrmly in place and not be in danger of being pushed\\nthrough the footing during construction, as might easily happen otherwise. The bent part of\\nthe bar does not count as part of the compression development length (ACI Code 12.5.5). The\\nreader should again note that the bar details shown in this ﬁgure are not satisfactory for seismic\\nareas as the bars should be bent inward and not outward.\\nAn alternative to the procedure described in the preceding paragraph is to place the\\nfooting concrete without dowels and then to push straight dowels down into the concrete\\nwhile it is still in a plastic state. This practice is permitted by the code in its Section 16.7.1\\nand is especially useful for plain concrete footings (to be discussed in Section 12.14 of this\\nchapter). It is essential that the dowels be maintained in their correct position as long as the\\nconcrete is plastic. Before the licensed design professional approves the use of straight dowels\\nas described here, he or she must be satisﬁed that the dowels will be properly placed and the\\nconcrete satisfactorily compacted around them.\\nThe code normally does not permit the use of lapped splices for #14 and #18 compression\\nbars because tests have shown that welded splices or other types of c onnections are necessary.\\nNevertheless, based on years of successful use, the code (15.8.2.3) states that #14 and #18\\nbars may be lap spliced with dowels (no larger than #11) to provide for force transfer at the\\nbase of columns or walls or pedestals. These dowels must extend into the supported member\\na distance of not less than ldc of #14 or #18 bars or the compression lap splice length of the\\ndowels, whichever is greater, and into the footing a distance not less than ldc of the dowels.\\nIf the computed development length of dowels is greater than the distance available from\\nthe top of the footing down to the top of the tensile steel, three possible solutions are available.\\nOne or more of the following alternatives may be selected:\\n1.

Should a square footing be feasible, it is normally more desirable\\nthan a rectangular one b ecause it will require less material and will be simpler to construct.\\nThe design procedure is almost identical with the one used for square footings. After\\nthe required area is calculated and the lateral dimensions are selected, the depths required for\\none-way and two-way shear are determined by the usual methods. One-way shear will very\\noften control the depths for rectangular footings, whereas two-way shear normally controls the\\ndepths of square footings.\\nThe next step is to select the reinforcing in the long direction. These longitudinal bars\\nare spaced uniformly across the footing, but such is not the case for the short-span reinforcing.\\nIn Figure 12.14, it can be seen that the support provided by the footing to the column will be\\nconcentrated near the middle of the footing, and thus the moment in the short direction will\\nbe concentrated somewhat in the same area near the column.\\nAs a result of this concentration effect, it seems only logical to concentrate a large\\nproportion of the short-span reinforcing in this area. The code (15.4.4.2) states that a certain\\nminimum percentage of the total short-span reinforcing should be pl aced in a band width equal\\nto the length of the shorter direction of the footing. The amount of reinforcing in this band is\\nto be determined with the following expression, in which β is the ratio of the length of the\\nlong side to the width of the short side of the footing:\\nReinforcing in band width\\nTotal reinforcing in short direction = 2\\nβ + 1 = γs (ACI Equation 15-1)\\nThe remaining reinforcing in the short direction should be uniformly sp aced over the\\nends of the footing, but the authors feel it should at least meet the shrinkage and temperature\\nrequirements of the ACI Code (7.12).\\nExample 12.5 presents the partial design of a rectangular footing in which the depths for\\none- and two-way shears are determined and the reinforcement selected.\\nF I G U R E 12.14Band width for steel in the short direction for\\nrectangular isolated footings.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 389}, page_content='McCormac c12.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:16 P.M.

One situation in which they may be used\\nis when the columns are so close together that isolated individual footings would run into\\neach other [see Figure 12.18(a)]. Another frequent use of combined footings occurs where one\\ncolumn is very close to a property line, causing the usual isolated footing to extend across the\\nline. For this situation, the footing for the exterior column may be combined with the one for\\nan interior column, as shown in Figure 12.18(b).\\nOn some occasions, where a column is close to a property line and where it is desired\\nto combine its footing with that of an interior column, the interior column will be so far away\\nas to make the idea impractical economically. For such a case, counterweights, or “deadmen,”\\nmay be provided for the outside column to take care of the eccentric loading.\\nF I G U R E 12.18Use of combined footings.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 392}, page_content='McCormac c12.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:16 P.M. Page 373\\n12.10 Combined Footings 373\\nRhodes Annex–Clemson University, 2008.\\nCombined footing (two column) after footing concrete is placed showing column reinforcing ready\\nfor splicing.\\nBecause it is desirable to make bearing pressures uniform throughout the footing, the cen-\\ntroid of the footing should be made to coincide with the centroid of the column loads to attempt\\nto prevent uneven settlements. This can beaccomplished with combined footings that are rect-\\nangular in plan. Should the interior column load be greater than that of the exterior column,\\nthe footing may be so proportioned that its centroid will be in the correct position by extending\\nthe inward projection of the footing, as shown in the rectangular footing of Figure 12.18(b).\\nOther combined footing shapes that will enable the designer to make the centroids coin-\\ncide are the trapezoid and strap or T footings shown in Figure 12.19. Footings with these\\nshapes are usually economical when there are large differences between the magnitudes of\\nthe column loads or where the spaces available do not lend themselves to long rectangular\\nfootings. When trapezoidal footings are used, the longitudinal bars are usually arranged in a\\nfan shape with alternate bars cut off some distance from the narrow end.\\nYou probably realize that a problem arises in establishing the centroids of loads and\\nfootings when deciding whether to use service or factored loads. The required centroid of the\\nfooting will be slightly different for the two cases. The authors determine the footing areas and\\ncentroids with the service loads (ACI Code 15.2.2), but the factored loads could be used with\\nreasonable results, too. The important point is to be consistent throughout the entire problem.\\nThe design of combined footings has not been standardized as have the procedures\\nused for the previous problems worked in this chapter. For this reason, practicing reinforced\\nconcrete designers use slightly varying approaches. One of these methods is described in the\\nparagraphs to follow.\\nFirst, the required area of the footing is determined for the service loads, and the footing\\ndimensions are selected so that the centroids coincide. The various loads are then multiplied by\\nthe appropriate load factors, and the shear and moment diagrams are drawn along the long side'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 393}, page_content='McCormac c12.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:16 P.M.

After the shear and moment diagrams are prepared, the depth\\nfor one- and two-way shear is determined, and the reinforcing in the long direction is selected.\\nIn the short direction, it is assumed that each column load is spread over a width in\\nthe long direction equal to the column width plus d/2 on each side if that much footing is\\navailable. Then the steel is designed, and a minimum amount of steel for temperature and\\nshrinkage is provided in the remaining part of the footing.\\nThe ACI Code does not specify an exact width for these transverse strips, and designers\\nmay make their own assumptions as to reasonable values. The width selected will probably\\nhave very little inﬂuence on the transverse bending capacity of the footing, but it can affect\\nappreciably its punching or two-way shear resistance. If the ﬂexural reinforcing is placed within\\nthe area considered for two-way shear, this lightly stressed reinforcing will reduce the width\\nof the diagonal shear cracks and will also increase the aggregate interlock along the shear\\nsurfaces.\\nSpace is not taken here to design completely a combined footing, but Example 12.6 is\\npresented to show those parts of the design that are different from the previous examples of this\\nchapter. A comment should be made about the moment diagram. If the length of the footing\\nis not selected so that its centroid is located exactly at the centroid of the column loads, the\\nmoment diagrams will not close well at all since the numbers are very sensitive. Nevertheless,\\nit is considered good practice to round off the footing lateral dimensions to the nearest 3 in.\\nAnother factor that keeps the moment diagram from closing is the fact that the average load\\nfactors of the various columns will be different if the column loads are different. We could\\nimprove the situation a little by taking the total column factored loads and dividing the result\\nby the total working loads to get an average load factor. This value (which works out to be\\n1.375 in Example 12.6) could then be multiplied by the total working load at each column and\\nused for drawing the shear and moment diagrams.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 394}, page_content='McCormac c12.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:16 P.M.

In the same way, if the footings of a\\nbuilding should settle by different amounts, the shears and moments throughout the structure\\nwill be greatly changed. In addition, there will be detrimental effects on the ﬁtting of doors,\\nwindows, and partitions. Should all the footings settle by the same amount, however, these\\nadverse effects will not occur. Thus, equal settlement is the goal of the designer.\\nThe footings considered in preceding sections have had their areas selected by taking the\\ntotal dead plus live loads and dividing the sum by the allowable soil pressure. It would seem\\nthat if such a procedure were followed for all the footings of an entire structure, the result\\nwould be uniform settlements throughout—but geotechnical engineers have clearly shown that\\nthis assumption may be very much ine r r o r.\\nA better way to handle the problem is to attempt to design the footings so that the usual\\nloads on each footing will cause approximately the same pressures. The usual loads consist of\\nthe dead loads plus the average percentage of live loads normally present. The usual percentage\\nof live loads present varies from building to building. For a church, it might be almost zero,\\nperhaps 25% to 30% for an ofﬁce building, and maybe 75% or more for some warehouses or\\nlibraries. Furthermore, the percentage in one part of a building may be entirely different from\\nthat in some other part (ofﬁces, storage, etc.).\\nOne way to handle the problem is to design the footing that has the highest ratio of\\nlive to dead load, compute the usual soil pressure under that footing using dead load plus\\nthe estimated average percentage of live load, and then determine the areas required for the\\nother footings so their usual soil pressures are all the same. It should be remembered that the\\ndead load plus 100% of the live load must not cause a pressure greater than the allowable soil\\npressure under any of the footings.\\nA student of soil mechanics will realize that this method of determining usual pressures,\\nthough not a bad design procedure, will not ensure equal settlements. This approach at best\\nwill only lessen the amounts of differential settlements.

These\\nmoments may be the result of gravity loads or lateral loads. Such a situation is represented by\\nthe vertical load P and the bending moment M shown in Figure 12.23.\\nMoment transfer from columns to footings depends on how the column–footing con-\\nnection is constructed. Many designers treat the connection between columns and footings as\\na pinned connection. Others treat it as ﬁxed, and still others treat it as somewhere in between.\\nIf it is truly pinned, no moment is transferred to the footing, and this section of the text is not\\napplicable. If, however, it is treated as ﬁxed or partially ﬁxed, this section is applicable.\\nIf a column–footing joint is to behave as a pin or hinge, it would have to be constructed\\naccordingly. The reinforcing in the column might be terminated at the column base instead of\\ncontinuing into the footing. Dowels would be provided, but these would not be adequate to\\nprovide a moment connection.\\nTo provide continuity at the column–footing interface, the reinforcing steel would have\\nto be continued into the footing. This is normally accomplished by embedding hooked bars\\ninto the footing and having them extend into the air where the columns will be located. The\\nlength they extend into the air must be at least the lap splice length; sometimes this can be\\na signiﬁcant length. These bars are then lap spliced or mechanically spliced with the column\\nbars, providing continuity of tension force in the reinforcing steel.\\nIf there is a moment transfer from the column to the footing, the resultant force will not\\ncoincide with the centroid of the footing. Of course, if the moment is constant in magnitude\\nand direction, it will be possible to place the center of the footing under the resultant load\\nand avoid the eccentricity, but lateral forces such as wind and eart hquake can come from any\\ndirection, and symmetrical footings will be needed.\\nThe effect of the moment is to produce a linearly varying soil pressure, which can be\\ndetermined at any point with the expression\\nq =− P\\nA ± Mc\\nI\\nIn this discussion, the term kern is used. If the resultant force strikes the footing base within\\nthe kern, the value of −P/A is larger than + Mc/I at every point, and the entire footing base\\nis in compression, as shown in Figure 12.23(a). If the resultant force strikes the footing base\\noutside the kern, the value of + Mc/I will at some points be larger than −P/A, and there will\\nbe uplift or tension. The soil–footing interface cannot resist tension, and the pressure variation\\nwill be as shown in Figure 12.23(b). The location of the kern can be determined by replacing\\nMc/I with Pec/I, equating it to P/A, and solving for e.\\n(a) Resultant load in kern\\n(b) Resultant load outside of kern\\nF I G U R E 12.23Soil stress distributions under footings with overturning moments.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 400}, page_content='McCormac c12.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:16 P.M.

To compute the pressure for such a situation, it is\\nnecessary to realize that the centroid of the upward pressure must for equilibrium coincide with\\nthe centroid of the vertical component of the downward load. In Figure 12.24, it is assumed\\nthat the distance to this point from the right edge of the footing is a. Since the centroid of a\\ntriangle is located at one-third of its base, the soil pressure will be spread over the distance 3 a\\nas shown. For a rectangular footing with dimensions l × b, the total upward soil pressure is\\nequated to the downward load, and the resulting expression is solved for qmax as follows:\\n(1\\n2\\n⎡\\n(3ab)(qmax) = P\\nqmax = 2P\\n3ab\\nExample 12.8 shows that the required area of a footing subjected to a vertical load and\\na lateral moment can be determined by trial and error. The procedure is to assume a size,\\ncalculate the maximum soil pressure, compare it with the allowable pressure, assume another\\nsize, and so on.\\nOnce the area has been established, the remaining design will be handled as it was for\\nother footings. Although the shears and moments are not uniform, the theory of design is\\nunchanged. The factored loads are computed, the bearing pressures are determined, and the\\nshears and moments are calculated. For strength design, the footing must be proportioned for\\nthe effects of these loads as required in ACI Section 9.2.\\nExample 12.8\\nDetermine the width needed for a wall footing to support loads:D = 18 k/ft andL = 12 k/ft.

Sometimes shear keys (see Figure 13.1 in Chapter 13) are used\\nbetween walls or columns and footings. This practice is of rather questionable value, however,\\nbecause appreciable slipping has to occur to develop a shear key. A shear key may be thought\\nof as providing an additional mechanical safety factor, but none of the lateral design force\\nshould be assigned to it.\\nThe following example illustrates the consideration of lateral force transfer by the shear\\nfriction concept.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 402}, page_content='McCormac c12.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:16 P.M.

Page 384\\n384 CHAPTER 1 2 Footings\\nChapter 22 of the ACI Code is devoted to the design of structural plain concrete. Struc-\\ntural plain concrete is deﬁned as concrete that is completely unreinforced or that contains less\\nthan the minimum required amounts of reinforcing previously speciﬁed here for reinforced con-\\ncrete members. The minimum compressive strength permitted for such concrete is 2500 psi, 3\\nas given in ACI Sections 22.2.3 and 1.1.1.\\nStructural plain concrete may be used only for (1) members continuously supported by\\nsoil or by other structural members that are capable of providing continuous support, (2) walls\\nand pedestals, and (3) structural members with arch action where compression occurs for all\\nloading cases (ACI Section 22.2.1).\\nThe code (22.7.3 and 22.7.4) states that when plain concrete footings are supported by\\nsoil, they cannot have an edge thickness less than 8 in. and they cannot be used on piles. The\\ncritical sections for shear and moment for plain concrete footings are the same as for reinforced\\nconcrete footings.\\nIn ACI Code Section 22.5, nominal bending and shear strengths are speciﬁed for structural\\nplain concrete. The proportions of plain concrete members will nearly always be controlled by\\ntensile strengths rather than shear strengths.\\nIn the equations that follow, φ = 0.60 (ACI 9.3.5) for all cases, S is the elastic section\\nmodulus of uncracked members, and βc is the ratio of the long side to the short side of the\\ncolumn or loaded area. In computing the strengths, whether ﬂexural or shear, for concrete cast\\nagainst soil, the overall thickness, h, is to be taken as 2 in. less than the actual th ickness (ACI\\nSection 22.4.7). This concrete is neglected to account for uneven excavation for the footing\\nand for some loss of mixing water to the soil and other contamination.\\nBending Strength:\\nMn = 5λ\\n√\\nf ′cS (ACI Equation 22-2)\\nφMn ≥ Mu (ACI Equation 22-1)\\nShear Strength for One-Way or Beam Action:\\nVn = 4\\n3 λ\\n√\\nf ′cbh (ACI Equation 22-9)\\nφVn ≥ Vu (ACI Equation 22-8)\\nShear Strength for Two-Way or Punching Action:\\nVn =\\n(4\\n3 + 8\\n3βc\\n⎡\\nλ\\n√\\nf ′cbo h (ACI Equation 22-10)\\n≤ 2.66λ\\n√\\nf ′cbo h\\nIn SI units\\nMn = 5\\n12 λ\\n√\\nf ′cS (ACI M Equation 22-2)\\nVn = 1\\n9 λ\\n√\\nf ′cbh (ACI M Equation 22-9)\\nVn = 1\\n9\\n(\\n1 + 2\\nβc\\n⎡\\nλ\\n√\\nf ′cbo h ≤ 2\\n9 λ\\n√\\nf ′cboh (ACI M Equation 22-10)\\n3\\n In SI units, it is 17 MPa.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 404}, page_content='McCormac c12.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:16 P.M.

On the other hand, the cost of purchasing reinforcing and placing\\nit will be eliminated. Furthermore, the use of plain concrete footings will enable us to save\\nconstruction time in that we don’t have to order the reinforcing and place it before the concrete\\ncan be poured. Therefore, plain concrete footings may be economical on more o ccasions than\\none might realize.\\nEven though plain footings are designed in accordance with the ACI requirements, they\\nshould, at the very least, be reinforced in the longitudinal direction to keep temperature and\\nshrinkage cracks within reason and to enable the footing to bridge over soft spots in the\\nunderlying soil.

Nowhshear = 19.12 in. Trial and error can be avoided\\nby using the Goal Seek feature. In the ﬁrst cycle, after tryingh = 12 in., go to the cell called trial\\nh − hshear.

The loose material being retained\\npushes against the wall, tending to overturn and slide it. Retaining walls are used in many\\ndesign situations where there are abrupt changes in the ground slope. Perhaps the most obvious\\nexamples to the reader occur along highway or railroad cuts and ﬁlls. Often retaining walls\\nare used in these locations to reduce the quantities of cut and ﬁll as well as to reduce the\\nright-of-way width required if the soils were allowed to assume their natural slopes. Retaining\\nwalls are used in many other locations as well, such as for bridge abutments, basement walls,\\nand culverts.\\nSeveral different types of retaining walls are discussed in the next section, but whichever\\ntype is used, there will be three forces involved that must be brought into equilibrium: (1) the\\ngravity loads of the concrete wall and any soil on top of the footing (the so-called developed\\nweight), (2) the lateral pressure from the soil, and (3) the bearing resistance of the soil. In\\naddition, the stresses within the structure have to be within permissible values, and the loads\\nmust be supported in a manner such that undue settlements do not occur. A retaining wall\\nmust be designed in such a way that the concrete elements that make up the wall comply with\\nthe ACI Code using, for the most part, principles already discussed in this text. In addition,\\nthe overall stability of the wall must be ensured. The wall may slide or tip over due to global\\ninstability without failure of the concrete elements.\\n13.2 Types of Retaining Walls\\nRetaining walls are generally classed as being gravity or cantilever types, with several varia-\\ntions possible. These are described in the paragraphs to follow, with reference being made to\\nFigure 13.1.\\nThe gravity retaining wall, shown in Figure 13.1(a), is used for walls of up to about 10\\nft to 12 ft in height. It is usually constructed with plain concrete and depends completely on\\nits own weight for stability against sliding and overturning. It is usually so massive that it is\\nunreinforced. Tensile stresses calculated by the working-stress method are usually kept below\\n1.6\\n√\\nf ′c. Gravity walls may also be constructed with stone or block masonry.\\nSemigravity retaining walls , shown in Figure 13.1(b), fall between the gravity and can-\\ntilever types (to be discussed in the next paragraph). They depend on their own weights plus\\nthe weight of some soil behind the wall to provide stability. Semigravity walls are used for\\napproximately the same range of heights as the gravity walls and usually have some light\\nreinforcement.\\nThe cantilever retaining wall or one of its variations is the most common type of retaining\\nwall. Such walls are generally used for heights from about 10 ft to 25 ft. In discussing retaining\\nwalls, the vertical wall is referred to as the stem.

This resisting\\nmoment is generally referred to as the righting moment.\\nWhen it is necessary to construct retaining walls of greater heights than approximately\\n20 ft to 25 ft, the bending moments at the junction of the stem and footing become so large\\nthat the designer will, from economic necessity, have to consider other types of walls to handle\\nthe moments. This can be done by introducing vertical cross walls on the front or back of the\\nstem. If the cross walls are behind the stem (i.e., inside the soil) and not visible, the retaining\\nwalls are calledcounterfort walls. Should the cross walls be visible (i.e., on the toe side), the\\nwalls are called buttress walls. These walls are illustrated in parts (d) and (e) of Figure 13.1.\\nThe stems for these walls are continuous members supported at intervals by the buttresses or\\ncounterforts. Counterforts or buttresses are usually spaced at distances approximately equal to\\none-half (or a little more) of the retaining wall heights.\\nThe counterfort type is more commonly used b ecause it is normally t hought to be more\\nattractive, as the cross walls or counterforts are not visible. Not only are the buttresses visible\\non the toe side, but their protrusion on the outside or toe side of the wall will use up valuable\\nspace. Nevertheless, buttresses are somewhat more efﬁcient than counterforts b ecause they\\nconsist of concrete that is put in compression by the overturning moments, whereas counterforts\\nare concrete members used in a tension situation, and they need to be tied to the wall with\\nstirrups. Occasionally, high walls are designed with both buttresses and counterforts.\\nFigure 13.2 presents a few other retaining wall variations.

Abutments may very well have wing wall extensions on the sides to retain\\nthe soil in the approach area. The abutment, in addition to other loads, will have to support\\nthe end reactions from the bridge.\\nThe use of precast retaining walls is becoming more common each year. The walls are\\nbuilt with some type of precast units, and the footings are probably poured in pl ace. The\\nresults are very attractive, and the units are high-quality concrete members made under “plant-\\ncontrolled” conditions. Less site preparation is required, and the erection of the walls is much\\nquicker than cast-in-place ones. The precast units can later be disassembled and the units used\\nagain. Other types of precast retaining walls consist of walls or sheeting actually driven into\\nthe ground before excavation. Also showing promise are gabions, or wire baskets of stone,\\nused in conjunction with geotextile-reinforced embankments.\\n13.3 Drainage\\nOne of the most important items in designing and constructing successful retaining walls is the\\nprevention of water accumulation behind the walls. If water is allowed to build up there, the\\nresult can be great lateral water pressure against the wall and perhaps an even worse situation\\nin cold climates due to frost action.\\nThe best possible backﬁll for a retaining wall is a well-drained and cohesionless soil.\\nThis is the condition for which the designer normally plans and designs. In addition to a\\ngranular backﬁll material, weep holes of 4 in. or more in diameter (the large sizes are used for\\neasy cleaning) are placed in the walls approximately 5 ft to 10 ft on center, horizontally and\\nvertically, as shown in Figure 13.3(a). If the backﬁll consists of a coarse sand, it is desirable to\\nput a few shovels of pea gravel around the weep holes to try to prevent the sand from stopping\\nup the holes.\\nWeep holes have the disadvantages that the water draining through the wall is somewhat\\nunsightly and also may cause a softening of the soil in the area of the highest soil pressure\\n(under the footing toe). A better method includes the use of a 6-in. or 8-in. perforated pipe in\\na bed of gravel running along the base of the wall, as shown in Figure 13.3(b). Unfortunately,\\nboth weep holes and drainage pipes can become clogged, with the result that increased water\\nweep holes\\n(4 in. or\\nlarger)\\nbackfill with\\nfree draining\\nsoil\\ngranular\\nmaterial of\\nsufficient\\nsize to avoid\\nplugging\\nweep holes\\n(a) Weep holes\\nweep\\nholes\\n(b) Drain pipe and perhaps\\n      weep holes too\\nbackfill with\\nfree-draining\\nsoil\\nperforated pipe\\ncovered with\\ngranular material\\n(cut hole in\\ncounterforts if\\nnecessary)\\nFIGURE 1 3 . 3 Retaining wall drainage.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 417}, page_content='McCormac c13.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:05 P.M.

Manufactured drainage blankets or porous mats placed between the wall\\nand the soil allow moisture to migrate freely to drainage systems, such as in Figure 13.3(b).\\nThe drainage methods described in the pr eceding paragraphs are also quite effective for\\nreducing frost action in colder areas. Frost action can cause very large movements of walls, not\\njust in terms of inches but perhaps even in terms of a foot or two, and over a period of time\\ncan lead to failures. Frost action, however, can be greatly reduced if coarse, properly drained\\nmaterials are placed behind the walls. The thickness of the ﬁll material perpendicular to a wall\\nshould equal at least the depth of frost penetration in the ground in that area.\\nThe best situation of all would be to keep the water out of the backﬁll altogether. Such\\na goal is normally impossible, but sometimes the surface of the backﬁll can be paved with\\nasphalt or some other material, or perhaps a surface drain can be provided to remove the water,\\nor it may be possible in some other manner to divert the water before it can get to the backﬁll.\\n13.4 Failures of Retaining Walls\\nThe number of failures or partial failures of retaining walls is rather alarming. The truth of the\\nmatter is that if large safety factors were not used, the situation would be even more severe.\\nOne reason for the large number of failures is the fact that designs are so often based on\\nmethods that are suitable only for certain special situations. For instance, if a wall that has a\\nsaturated clay behind it (never a good idea) is designed by a method that is suitable for a dry\\ngranular material, future trouble will be the result.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 418}, page_content='McCormac c13.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:05 P.M. Page 399\\n13.5 Lateral Pressure on Retaining Walls 399\\n13.5 Lateral Pressure on Retaining Walls\\nThe actual pressures that occur behind retaining walls are quite difﬁcult to estimate because of\\nthe large number of variables present. These include the kinds of backﬁll materials and their\\ncompactions and moisture contents, the types of materials beneath the footings, the presence\\nor absence of surcharge, and other variables. As a result, the detailed estimation of the lateral\\nforces applied to various retaining walls is clearly a problem in theoretical soil mechanics. For\\nthis reason, the discussion to follow is limited to a rather narrow range of cases.\\nIf a retaining wall is constructed against a solid rock face, there will be no pressure applied\\nto the wall by the rock. If the wall is built to retain a body of water, however, hydrostatic\\npressure will be applied to the wall. At any point, the pressure, p, will equal wh,w h e r ew is\\nthe unit weight of the water and h is the vertical distance from the surface of the water to the\\npoint in question.\\nIf a wall is built to retain a soil, the soil’s behavior will generally be somewhere between\\nthat of rock and water ( but as you will learn, the pressure caused by some soils is much higher\\nthan that caused by water). The pressure exerted against the wall will increase, as did the water\\npressure, with depth but usually not as rapidly.

Figure 13.4\\npresents charts that are sometimes used for estimating the vertical and horizontal pressures\\napplied by soil backﬁlls of up to 20-ft heights. Several different types of backﬁll materials are\\nconsidered in the ﬁgure. Use of this chart is limited to walls not over about 20 ft high. (1) Back-\\nﬁll of coarse-grained soil without admixture of ﬁne particles, very permeable, as clean sand or\\ngravel. (2) Backﬁll of coarse-grained soil of low permeability b ecause of admixture of particles\\nof silt size. (3) Backﬁll of ﬁne silty sand, granular materials with conspicuous clay content,\\nand residual soil with stones. (4) Backﬁll of soft or very soft clay, organic silt, or silty clay. 1\\nUnit weights of soils will vary roughly as follows: 90 lb/ft 3 to 100 lb/ft 3 for soft clays,\\n100 lb/ft3 to 120 lb/ft 3 for stiff clays, 110 lb/ft 3 to 120 lb/ft 3 for sands, and 120 lb/ft 3 to 130\\nlb/ft3 for sand and gravel mixes.\\nIf you carefully study the second chart of Figure 13.4, you will probably be amazed to\\nsee how high lateral pressures can be, particularly for clays and silts. As an illustration, a 1-ft-\\nwide vertical strip is considered for a 15-ft-high retaining wall backﬁlled with soil number (4)\\nwith an assumedδ of 10◦ (6 : 1 slope).

Part of the earth behind the wall (shown by the hatched area) tends to slide\\nalong a curved surface (represented by the dashed line) and push against the retaining wall. The\\ntendency of this soil to slide is resisted by friction along the soil underneath (calledinternal\\nfriction) and by friction along the vertical face of the retaining wall.\\nInternal friction is greater for a cohesive soil than for a noncohesive one, but the wetter\\nsuch a soil becomes, the smaller will be its cohesiveness and, thus, the ﬂatter the plane of\\nrupture. The ﬂatter the plane of rupture, the greater is the volume of earth tending to slide and\\npush against the wall. Once again, it is clear that good drainage is of the utmost importance.\\nUsually the designer assumes that a cohesionless granular backﬁll will be placed behind the\\nwalls.\\nDue to lateral pressure, the usual retaining wall will give or deﬂect a little b ecause it\\nis constructed of elastic materials. Furthermore, unless the wall rests on a rock foundation,\\nit will tilt or lean a small distance away from the soil due to the compressible nature of the\\nsupporting soils. For these reasons, retaining walls are frequently constructed with a slight\\nbatter, or inclination, toward the backﬁll so that the deformations described are not obvious to\\npassersby.\\nUnder the lateral pressures described, the usual retaining wall will move a little distance\\nand active soil pressure will develop, as shown in Figure 13.6. Among the many factors that\\naffect the pressure applied to a particular wall are the kind of backﬁll material used, the drainage\\nsituation, the level of the water table, the seasonal conditions such as dry or wet or frozen, the\\npresence of trucks or other equipment on the backﬁll, and so on.\\nFor design purposes, it is usually satisfactory to assume that the active pressure varies\\nlinearly with the depth of the backﬁll. In other words, it is just as though (so far as lateral\\npressure is concerned) there is a liquid of some weight behind the wall that can vary from\\nconsiderably less than the weight of water to considerably more. The chart of Figure 13.4\\nshows this large variation in possible lateral pressures.

V alues from 30 pcf to 50 pcf are normally assumed but\\nmay be much too low for clay and silt materials.\\nIf the wall moves away from the backﬁll and against the soil at the toe, a passive soil\\npressure will be the result. Passive pressure, which is also assumed to vary linearly with depth,\\nis illustrated in Figure 13.6. The inclusion or noninclusion of passive pressure in the design\\ncalculations is a matter of judgment on the designer’s part. For effective passive pressure to\\nbe developed at the toe, the toe concrete must be placed against undisturbed earth without the\\nuse of vertical forms. Even if this procedure is followed, the designer will probably reduce the\\nheight of the undisturbed soil (h′ in Figure 13.6) used in the calculations to account for some\\ndisturbance of the earth during construction operations.\\nAs long as the backﬁlls are granular, noncohesive, and dry, the assumption of an equiv-\\nalent liquid pressure is fairly satisfactory. Formulas based on an assumption of dry sand or\\ngravel backﬁlls are not satisfactory for soft clays or saturated sands. Actually, clays should\\nnot be used for backﬁlls because their shear characteristics change easily and they may tend\\nto creep against the wall, increasing pressures as time goes by.\\nIf a linear pressure variation is assumed, the active pressure at any depth can be deter-\\nmined as\\npa = ka wh\\nor, for passive pressure,\\npp = kp wh′\\nIn these expressions, ka and kp are the approximate coefﬁcients of active and passive pressures,\\nrespectively. These coefﬁcients can be calculated by theoretical equations such as those of\\nRankine or Coulomb. 2 For a granular material, typical values of ka and kp are 0.3 and 3.3.\\nThe Rankine equation (published in 1857) neglects the friction of the soil on the wall, whereas\\nthe Coulomb formula (published in 1776) takes it into consideration. These two equations\\nwere developed for cohesionless soils. For cohesive soils containing clays and/or silts, it is\\nnecessary to use empirical values determined from ﬁeld measurements (such as those given in\\nFigure 13.4).\\nIt has been estimated that the cost of constructing retaining walls varies directly with the\\nsquare of their heights.

Since\\nthe Coulomb equation does take into account friction on the wall, it is thought to be the more\\naccurate one and is often used for walls of over 20 ft. The Rankine equation is commonly\\nused for ordinary retaining walls of 20 ft or less in height. It is interesting to note that the two\\nmethods give identical results if the friction of the soil on the wall is neglected.\\nThe Rankine expressions for the active and passive pressure coefﬁcients are given\\nat the end of this paragraph with reference to Figure 13.7. In these expressions, δ is\\nthe angle the backﬁll makes with the horizontal, while φ is the angle of internal friction of\\nthe soil.

As a result,\\nthe values of ka can vary from perhaps 0.30 for some granular materials up to about 1.0 for\\nsome wet clays.\\nOnce the values of ka and kp are determined, the total horizontal pressures, Ha and Hp ,\\ncan be calculated as being equal to the areas of the respective triangular pressure diagrams.\\nFor instance, with reference to Figure 13.7, the value of the active pressure is\\nHa =\\n(1\\n2\\n⎡\\n(pa )(h) =\\n(1\\n2\\n⎡\\n(ka wh)(h)\\nHa = ka wh2\\n2'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 423}, page_content='McCormac c13.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:05 P.M.

For such cases, the soil pressures can be determined as previously\\ndescribed in Section 12.12 and Figure 12.24 in Chapter 12. Such a situation should not be\\npermitted in a retaining wall and is not considered further.\\nThe soil pressures computed in this manner are only rough estimates of the real values\\nand, thus, should not be valued too highly. The true pressures are appreciably affected by quite\\na few items other than the retaining wall weight. Included are drainage conditions, temperature,\\nsettlement, pore water, and so on.\\n13.7 Design of Semigravity Retaining Walls\\nAs previously mentioned, semigravity retaining walls are designed to resist earth pressure\\nby means of their own weight plus some developed soil weight. Because they are normally\\nconstructed with plain concrete, stone, or perhaps some other type of masonry, their design\\nis based on the assumption that only very little tension or none at all can be permitted in the\\nstructure. If the resultant of the earth pressure and the wall weight (including any developed soil\\nweight) falls within the middle third of the wall base, tensile stresses will probably be negligible.\\nA wall size is assumed, safety factors against sliding and overturning are calculated, the\\npoint where the resultant force strikes the base is determined, and the soil pressures are calcu-\\nlated. It is normally felt that safety factors against sliding should be at least 1.5 for cohesionless\\nbackﬁlls and 2.0 for cohesive ones. Safety factors of 2.0 for overturning are normally speciﬁed.\\nA suitable wall is probably obtained after two or three trial sizes. Example 13.1 illustrates the\\ncalculations that need to be made for each trial.\\nFigure 13.8(a) shows a set of approximate dimensions that are often used for sizing\\nsemigravity walls. Dimensions may be assumed to be approximately equal to the values given\\nand the safety factors against overturning and sliding computed. If the values are not suitable,\\nthe dimensions are adjusted and the safety factors are recalculated, and so on.

In other words, the length of the footing and\\nthe position of the stem on the footing are based entirely on the actual soil backﬁll, estimated\\nlateral pressure, coefﬁcient of sliding friction of the soil, and so on.\\nOn the other hand, the detailed designs of the stem and footing and their reinforcing are\\ndetermined by the strength design method. To carry out these calculations, it is n ecessary to\\nmultiply the service loads and pressures by the appropriate load factors. From these factored\\nloads, the bearing pressures, moments, and shears are determined for use in the design.\\nThus, the initial part of the design consists of an approximate sizing of the retaining wall.\\nAlthough this is actually a trial-and-error procedure, the values obtained are not too sensitive\\nto slightly incorrect values, and usually one or two trials are sufﬁcient.\\nV arious rules of thumb are available with which excellent initial size estimates can be\\nmade. In addition, various handbooks present the ﬁnal sizes of retaining walls that have been\\ndesigned for certain speciﬁc cases. This information will enable the designer to estimate very\\nwell the proportions of a wall to be designed. TheCRSI Design Handbook is one such useful\\nreference.3 In the next few paragraphs, suggested methods are presented for estimating sizes\\nwithout the use of a handbook. These approximate methods are very satisfactory as long as\\nthe conditions are not too much out of the ordinary.\\nHeight of Wall\\nThe necessary elevation at the top of the wall is normally obvious from the conditions of the\\nproblem. The elevation at the base of the footing should be selected so that it is below frost\\npenetration in the particular area—about 3 ft to 6 ft below ground level in the northern part\\nof the United States. From these elevations, the overall height of the wall can be determined.\\nStem Thickness\\nStems are theoretically thickest at their bases because the shears and moments are greatest\\nthere. They will ordinarily have total thicknesses somewhere in the range of 7% to 12% of the\\noverall heights of the retaining walls. The shears and moments in the stem decrease from the\\nbottom to the top; as a result, thicknesses and reinforcement can be reduced proportionately.\\nStems are normally tapered, as shown in Figure 13.12. The minimum thickness at the top of\\nthe stem is 8 in., with 12 in. preferable. As will be shown in Section 13.10, it is necessary to\\nhave a mat of reinforcing in the inside face of the stem and another mat in the outside face.\\nstem reinforcing for moment\\ntemperature and shrinkage reinforcing\\nF I G U R E 13.12Cantilever retaining wall with\\ntapered stem.\\n3 Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute, 2008, CRSI Design Handbook , 10th ed.

Page 410\\n410 CHAPTER 1 3 Retaining Walls\\nTo provide room for these two mats of reinforcing, for cover and spacing between the mats, a\\nminimum total thickness of at least 8 in. is required.\\nThe use of the minimum thickness possible for walls that are primarily reinforced in one\\ndirection (here it’s the vertical bars) doesn’t necessarily provide the best economy. The reason\\nis that the reinforcing steel is a major part of the total cost. Making the walls as thin as possible\\nwill save some concrete but will substantially increase the amount of reinforcing needed. For\\nfairly high and heavily loaded walls, greater thicknesses of concrete may be economical.\\nIf ρ in the stem is limited to a maximum value of approximately (0.18f ′\\nc/fy),t h es t e m\\nthickness required for moment will probably provide sufﬁcient shear resistance without using\\nstirrups. Furthermore, it will probably be sufﬁciently thick to limit lateral deﬂections to rea-\\nsonable values.\\nFor heights up to about 12 ft, the stems of cantilever retaining walls are normally made\\nof constant thickness because the extra cost of se tting the tapered formwork is usually not\\noffset by the savings in concrete. Above 12-ft heights, concrete savings are usually sufﬁciently\\nlarge to make tapering economical.\\nActually, the sloping face of the wall can be either the front or the back, but if the outside\\nface is tapered, it will tend to counteract somewhat the deﬂection and tilting of the wall because\\nof lateral pressures. A taper or batter of 1\\n4 in. per foot of height is often recommended to offset\\ndeﬂection or the forward tilting of the wall.\\nBase Thickness\\nThe ﬁnal thickness of the base will be determined on the basis of shears and moments. For\\nestimating, however, its total thickness will probably fall somewhere between 7% and 10% of\\nthe overall wall height. Minimum thicknesses of at least 10 in. to 12 in. are used.\\nBase Length\\nFor preliminary estimates, the base length can be taken to be about 40% to 60% of the overall\\nwall height. A little better estimate, however, can be made by using the method described by\\nthe late Professor Ferguson in his reinforced concrete text. 4 For this discussion, reference is\\nmade to Figure 13.13. In this ﬁgure, W is assumed to equal the weight of all the material\\nwithin area abcd. This area contains both concrete and soil, but the authors assume here that it\\nis all soil.

Each of these parts will be designed individually as a cantilever sticking out of a\\ncentral mass, as shown in Figure 13.17.\\nStem\\nThe values of shear and moment at the base of the stem resulting from lateral earth pressures\\nare computed and used to determine the stem thickness and necessary reinforcing. Because the\\nlateral pressures are considered to be live load forces, a load factor of 1.6 is used.\\nIt will be noted that the bending moment requires the use of vertical reinforcing bars on\\nthe soil side of the stem. In addition, temperature and shrinkage reinforcing must be provided.\\nIn Section 14.3 of the ACI Code, a minimum value of horizontal reinforcing equal to 0.0025\\nF I G U R E 13.17Cantilever beam model used to design retaining wall stem, heel, and toe.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 433}, page_content='McCormac c13.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:05 P.M. Page 414\\n414 CHAPTER 1 3 Retaining Walls\\nof the area of the wall, bt, is required as well as a minimum amount of vertical reinforcing\\n(0.0015). These values may be reduced to 0.0020 and 0.0012 if the reinforcing is 5\\n8 in. or less\\nin diameter and if it consists of bars or welded wire fabric (not larger than W31 or D31), with\\nfy equal to or greater than 60,000 psi.\\nThe major changes in temperature occur on the front or exposed face of the stem. For this\\nreason, most of the horizontal reinforcing (perhaps two-thirds) should be pl aced on that face\\nwith just enough vertical steel used to support the horizontal bars. The concrete for a retaining\\nwall should be pl aced in fairly short lengths—not greater than 20-ft or 30-ft sections—to\\nreduce shrinkage stresses.\\nFactor of Safety Against Overturning\\nMoments are taken about the toe of the unfactored overturning and righting forces. Tradition-\\nally, it has been felt that the safety factor against overturning should be at least equal to 2. In\\nmaking these calculations, backﬁll on the toe is usually neglected because it may very well\\nbe eroded. Of course, there are cases where there is a slab (e.g., a highway pavement on top\\nof the toe backﬁll) that holds the backﬁll in place over the toe. For such situations, it may be\\nreasonable to include the loads on the toe.\\nFactor of Safety Against Sliding\\nConsideration of sliding for retaining walls is a most important topic because a very large\\npercentage of retaining wall failures occur because of sliding. To calculate the factor of safety\\nagainst sliding, the estimated sliding resistance (equal to the coefﬁcient of friction for concrete\\non soil times the resultant vertical force,μRv ) is divided by the total horizontal force. The\\npassive pressure against the wall is neglected, and the unfactored loads are used.\\nTypical design values of μ, the coefﬁcient of friction between the footing concrete and\\nthe supporting soil, are as follows: 0.45 to 0.55 for coarse-grained soils, with the lower value\\napplying if some silt is present, and 0.6 if the footing is supported on sound rock with a rough\\nsurface. Values of 0.3 to 0.35 are used if the s upporting material is silt.\\nIt is usually felt that the factor of safety against sliding should be at least equal to 1.5.\\nWhen retaining walls are initially designed, the calculated factor of safety against sliding is\\nvery often considerably less than this value. To correct the situation, the most common practice\\nis to widen the footing on the heel side. Another practice is to use a lug or key, as shown in\\nFigure 13.18, with the front face cast directly against undisturbed soil.

Keys are\\nthought to be particularly necessary for moist clayey soils. The purpose of a key is to cause the\\ndevelopment of passive pressure in front of and below the base of the footing, as shown by Pp\\nin the ﬁgure. The actual theory involved, and thus the design of keys, is still a question among\\ngeotechnical engineers. As a result, many desi gners select the sizes of keys by rules of thumb.\\nOne common practice is to give them a depth b etween two-thirds and the full depth of the\\nfooting. They are usually made approximately square in cross section and have no reinforcing\\nprovided other than perhaps the dowels mentioned in the next paragraph.\\nKeys are often located below the stem so that some dowels or extended vertical reinforc-\\ning may be extended into them. If this procedure is used, the front face of the key needs to be\\nat least 5 in. or 6 in. in front of the back face of the stem to allow room for the dowels. From\\na soil mechanics view, keys may be a little more effective if they are placed a little farther\\ntoward the heel.\\nIf the key can be extended down into a very ﬁrm soil or even rock, the result will be a\\ngreatly increased sliding resistance—that resistance being equal to the force necessary to shear\\nthe key off from the footing, that is, a shear friction calculated as described in Sections 8.12\\nand 12.13 of this text.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 435}, page_content='McCormac c13.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:05 P.M. Page 416\\n416 CHAPTER 1 3 Retaining Walls\\nHeel Design\\nLateral earth pressure tends to cause the retaining wall to rotate about its toe. This action tends\\nto pick up the heel into the backﬁll. The backﬁll pushes down on the heel cantilever, causing\\ntension in its top. The major force applied to the heel of a retaining wall is the downward\\nweight of the backﬁll behind the wall. Although it is true that there is some upward soil\\npressure, many designers choose to neglect it b ecause it is relatively small. The downward\\nloads tend to push the heel of the footing down, and the necessary upward reaction to hold\\nit attached to the stem is provided by the vertical tensile steel in the stem, which is extended\\ndown into the footing.\\nBecause the reaction in the direction of the shear does not intr oduce compression into\\nthe heel part of the footing in the region of the stem, it is not permissible to determine Vu at\\na distance d from the face of the stem, as provided in Section 11.1.3.1 of the ACI Code. The\\nvalue of Vu is determined instead at the face of the stem because of the downward loads. This\\nshear is often of such magnitude as to control the thickness, but the moment at the face of the\\nstem should be checked also. Because the load here consists of soil and concrete, a load factor\\nof 1.2 is used for making the calculations.\\nIt will be noted that the bars in the heel will be in the top of the footing. As a result, the\\nrequired development length of these “top bars” may be rather large.\\nThe percentage of ﬂexural steel required for the heel frequently is less than the ρmin of\\n200/fy and 3\\n√\\nf ′c/fy. Despite the fact that the ACI Code (10.5.4) exempts slabs of uniform\\nfrom these ρmin values, the authors recommend that these be used because the retaining wall\\nis a major beamlike structure.\\nToe Design\\nThe toe is assumed to be a beam cantilevered from the front face of the stem. The loads it must\\nsupport include the weight of the cantilever slab and the upward soil pressure beneath. Usually\\nany earth ﬁll on top of the toe is neglected (as though it has been eroded). Obviously, such a\\nﬁll would increase the upward soil pressure beneath the footing, but because it acts downward\\nand cancels out the upward pressure, it produces no appreciable changes in the shears and\\nmoments in the toe.\\nA study of Figure 13.19 shows that the upward soil pressure is the major force applied\\nto the toe. Because this pressure is primarily caused by the lateral force H, a load factor of 1.6\\nis used for the calculations. (Section 4.1 of this text shows that all load combinations including\\nsoil loads have a load factor of 1.6 associated with H.)

The average designer makes the thickness\\nof the toe the same as the thickness of the heel, although such a practice is not essential.\\nIt is a common practice in retaining wall construction to provide a shear keyway between\\nthe base of the stem and the footing. This practice, though deﬁnitely not detrimental, is of ques-\\ntionable value. The keyway is normally formed by pushing a beveled 2 in.× 4 in. or 2 in. ×\\n6 in. into the top of the footing, as shown in Figure 13.20. After the concrete hardens, the\\nwood member is removed, and when the stem is cast in place above, a keyway is formed. It is\\nbecoming more and more common simply to use a roughened surface on the top of the footing\\nwhere the stem will be placed. This practice seems to be just as satisfactory as the use of a\\nkeyway.\\nIn Example 13.3, #8 bars 6 in. on center are selected for the vertical steel at the base\\nof the stem. These bars need to be embedded into the footing for development purposes, or\\ndowels equal to the stem steel need to be used for the transfer. This latter practice is quite\\ncommon because it is rather difﬁcult to hold the stem steel in position while the base concrete\\nis placed.\\nThe required development length of the #8 bars down into the footing or for #8 dowels\\nis 33 in. when fy = 60,000 psi and f ′\\nc = 3000 psi. This length cannot be obtained vertically in\\nthe 1-ft-6-in. footing used unless the bars or dowels are either bent as shown in Figure 13.21(a)\\nor extended through the footing and into the base key as shown in Figure 13.21(b).

Actually, after\\nexamining Figure 13.21(a), you can see that such an arrangement of stem steel can sometimes\\nbe very advantageous economically.\\nThe bending moment in the stem decreases rapidly above the base; as a result, the amount\\nof reinforcing can be similarly reduced.

Table 13.1 shows the reduced bending moments\\nup in the stem and the corresponding reductions in reinforcing required.\\nAfter considering the possible arrangements of the steel in Figure 13.21 and the required\\nareas of steel at different elevations in Table 13.1, the authors decided to use dowels for load\\ntransfer at the stem base.\\nUse #8 dowels at 6 in. extending 33 in. down into footing and key.\\nIf these dowels are spliced to the vertical stem reinforcing with no more than one-\\nhalf the bars being spliced within the required lap length, the splices will fall into the class\\nB category (ACI Code 12.15), and their lap length should at least equal 1.3ld = (1.3)(33) =\\n43 in. Therefore, two dowel lengths are used—half 3 ft 7 in. up into the stem and the other half\\n7 ft 2 in.—and the #7 bars are lapped over them, half running to the top of the wall and the other\\nhalf to middepth. Actually, a much more reﬁned design can be made that involves more cutting\\nof bars. For such a design, a diagram comparing the theoretical steel area required at various\\nelevations in the stem and the actual steel furnished is very useful. It is to be remembered (ACI\\nCode 12.10.3) that the bars cut off must run at least a distanced or 12 diameters beyond their\\ntheoretical cutoff points and must also meet the necessary development length requirements.\\n13.11 Cracks and Wall Joints\\nObjectionable horizontal cracks are rare in retaining walls because the compression faces\\nare the ones that are visible. When they do occur, it is usually a sign of an unsatisfactory\\nstructural design and not shrinkage. In Chapter 6 of this book, the ACI procedure (Section\\n10.6) for limiting crack sizes in tensile zones of one-way beams and slabs was presented.\\nThese provisions may be applied to vertical retaining wall steel. However, they are usually\\nthought unnecessary because the vertical steel is on the earth side of the wall.\\nV ertical cracks in walls, however, are quite common unless sufﬁcient construction joints\\nare used. Vertical cracks are related to the relief of tension stresses because of shrinkage, with\\nthe resulting tensile forces ex ceeding the l ongitudinal steel capacity.\\nConstruction joints may be used both horizontally and vertically between su ccessive\\npours of concrete. The surface of the hardened concrete can be cleaned and roughened, or keys\\ncan be used as shown in Figure 13.28(a) to form horizontal construction joints.\\nIf concrete is restrained from free movement when shrinking—for example, by being\\nattached to more rigid parts of the structure—it will crack at points of weakness. Contraction\\njoints are weakened places constructed so that shrinkage failures will occur at prepared loca-\\ntions. When the shrinkage tensile stresses become too large, they will pull these contraction'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 444}, page_content='McCormac c13.tex V2 - January 10, 2013 9:51 P.M.

In addition to handling shrinkage problems, contraction joints are useful in handling dif-\\nferential settlements. They need to be spaced at intervals a bout 25 ft on center (the AASHTO\\nsays not greater than 30 ft). The joints are usually constructed with rubber strips that are left\\nin place or with wood strips that are later removed and replaced with caulking.\\nExpansion joints are vertical joints that completely separate the different parts of a wall.\\nThey are placed approximately 50 ft to 100 ft on centers (the AASHTO says maximum spacing\\nshould not be greater than 90 ft). Reinforcing bars are generally run through all joints so that\\nvertical and horizontal alignment is maintained. When the bars do run through a joint, one end\\nof the bars on one side of the joint is either greased or sheathed so that the desired expansion\\ncan take place.\\nCourtesy of EFCO Corp.\\nBox culvert.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 445}, page_content='McCormac c13.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:05 P.M.

A rough value for the width of an\\nexpansion joint can be determined from the following expression, in which /Delta1L is the change in\\nlength, L is the distance between joints, /Delta1T is the estimated temperature change, and 0.000005\\nper unit length per degree Fahrenheit is the estimated coefﬁcient of contraction of the wall.\\n/Delta1L = (0.000005L)( /Delta1T )\\nPROBLEMS\\nFor Problems 13.1 to 13.4, use the Rankine equation to calculate the total horizontal active force and the overturning moment for\\nthe wall shown.

For instance, the concrete for a whole ﬂoor or for a large part of it, including\\nthe supporting beams and girders and parts of the columns, may be pl aced at the same time.\\nThe reinforcing bars extend from member to member, as from one span of a beam into the\\nnext. When there are construction joints, the reinforcing bars are left protruding from the older\\nconcrete, so they may be lapped or spliced to the bars in the newer concrete. In addition, the\\nold concrete is cleaned so that the newer concrete will bond to it as well as possible. The result\\nof all these facts is that reinforced concrete structures are generally monolithic or continuous\\nand, thus, statically indeterminate.\\nA load placed in one span of a conti nuous structure will cause shears, moments, and\\ndeﬂections in the other spans of that structure. Not only are the beams of a reinforced concrete\\nstructure continuous, but the entire structure is also continuous. In other words, loads applied\\nto a column affect the beams, slabs, and other columns, and vice versa.\\nThe result is that more economical structures are obtained b ecause the bending moments\\nare smaller, and thus member sizes are smaller. Although the analyses and designs of continuous\\nstructures are more complicated than they are for statically determinate structures, this fact has\\nbecome less important because of the constantly increasing availab ility of good software.\\n14.2 General Discussion of Analysis Methods\\nIn reinforced concrete design today, we use elastic methods to analyze structures loaded with\\nfactored or ultimate loads. Such a procedure probably doesn’t seem quite correct to the reader,\\nbut it does yield satisfactory results. The reader might very well ask, “Why don’t we use\\nultimate or inelastic analyses for reinforced concrete structures?” The answer is that our theory\\nand tests are just not sufﬁciently advanced.\\nIt is true that under certain circumstances, some modiﬁcations of moments are permitted\\nto recognize ultimate or inelastic behavior as described in Section 14.5 of this chapter. In\\ngeneral, however, we will discuss elastic analyses for reinforced concrete structures. Actually,\\nno method of analysis, elastic or inelastic, will give exact results because of theunknown\\neffects of creep, settlement, shrinkage, workmanship, and so on.\\n14.3 Qualitative Inﬂuence Lines\\nMany methods might be used to analyze continuous structures. The most common hand cal-\\nculation method is moment distribution, but other methods are frequently used, such as matrix\\nmethods, computer solutions, and others. Whichever method is used, you should understand\\nthat to determine maximum shears and moments at different sections in the structure, it is\\nnecessary to consider different positions of the live loads. As a background for this material,\\na brief review of qualitative inﬂuence lines is presented.\\n431'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 451}, page_content='McCormac c14.tex V2 - January 10, 2013 9:57 P.M.

This principle is as follows: The deﬂected shape of a structure rep-\\nresents to some scale the inﬂuence line for a function such as reaction, shear, or moment ift h e\\nfunction in question is allowed to act through a small d istance. In other words, the structure\\ndraws its own inﬂuence line when the proper displacement is made.\\nThe shape of the usual inﬂuence line needed for continuous structures is so simple to\\nobtain with the M¨uller-Breslau principle that, in many situations, it is unn ecessary to compute\\nthe numerical values of the coordinates. It is possible to sketch the diagram roughly with\\nsufﬁcient accuracy to locate the critical positions for live loads for various functions of the\\nstructure. These diagrams are referred to as qualitative inﬂuence lines, whereas those with\\nnumerical values are referred to as quantitative inﬂuence lines.1\\nIf the inﬂuence line is desired for the left reaction of the continuous beam of\\nFigure 14.1(a), its general shape can be determined by letting the r eaction act upward through\\na unit distance, as shown in Figure 14.1(b). If the left end of the beam is pushed up, the\\nbeam will take the shape shown. This distorted shape can be sketched easily by remembering\\nthat the other supports are considered to be unyielding. The inﬂuence line forVc ,d r a w ni na\\nsimilar manner, is shown in Figure 14.1(c).\\nFigure 14.1(d) shows the inﬂuence line for positive moment at point x near the center\\nof the left-hand span. The beam is assumed to have a pin or hinge inserted at x and a couple\\nis applied adjacent to each side of the pin, which will cause compression in the top ﬁbers.\\nBending the beam on each side of the pin causes the left span to take the shape indicated, and\\nthe deﬂected shape of the remainder of the beam may be roughly sketched. A similar procedure\\n1 McCormac, J. C., 2007, Structural Analys is: Using Classical and Matr ix Methods , 4th ed.

At point\\nx, the beam is assumed to be cut, and the two vertical forces of the nature required to give\\npositive shear are applied to the beam on the sides of the cut section. The beam will take\\nthe shape shown in Figure 14.1(f). The same procedure is used in Figure 14.1(g) to draw a\\ndiagram for positive shear at point y. (Theoretically, for qualitative shear inﬂuence lines, it is\\nnecessary to have a moment on each side of the cut section sufﬁcient to maintain equal slopes.\\nSuch moments are indicated in parts (f) and (g) of the ﬁgure by the letter M.)\\nFrom these diagrams, considerable information is available concerning critical live load-\\ning conditions. If a maximum positive value of VA were desired for a uniform live load, the\\nload would be placed in spans 1 and 3, where the diagram has pos itive ordinates; if maximum\\nnegative moment were required at point y, spans 2 and 4 would be loaded, and so on.\\nQualitative inﬂuence lines are particularly valuable for determining critical load positions\\nfor buildings, as illustrated by the moment inﬂuence line for the building of Figure 14.2.

The inﬂuence line shown in the ﬁgure is for\\npositive moment at the center of beamAB.\\nThe spans that should be loaded to cause maximum positive moment are obvious from\\nthe diagram. It should be realized that loads on a member more than approximately three spans\\naway have little effect on the function under consideration.\\nIn the last few paragraphs, inﬂuence lines have been used to determine the critical\\npositions for placing live loads to cause maximum moments. The same results can be obtained\\n(and perhaps more easily) by considering the deﬂected shape or curvature of a member under\\nload. If the live loads are placed so that they cause the greatest curvature at a particular point,\\nthey will have bent the structure the greatest amount at that point, which means that the greatest\\nmoment will have been obtained.\\nFor the continuous beam of Figure 14.3(a), it is desired to cause the maximum negative\\nmoment at support B by the proper placement of a uniform live load. In part (b) of the ﬁgure,\\nthe deﬂected shape of the beam is sketched as it would be when a negative moment occurs at\\nB, and the rest of the beam’s deﬂected shape is drawn as shown by the dashed line. The live\\nuniform load is then placed in the locations that would exaggerate that deﬂected shape. This\\nis done by placing the load in spans 1, 2, and 4.\\nA similar situation is shown in Figure 14.3(c), where it is desired to obtain maximum\\npositive moment at the middle of the second span. The deﬂected shape of the beam is sketched\\nas it would be when a positive moment occurs in that span, and the rest of the beam’s deﬂected\\nshape is drawn in. To exaggerate this positive or downward bending in the second span, it can\\nbe seen that the live load should be pl aced in spans 2 and 4.\\n14.4 Limit Design\\nIt can be clearly shown that a statically indeterminate beam or frame normally will not collapse\\nwhen its ultimate moment capacity is r eached at just one section. Instead, there is a redistribu-\\ntion of the moments in the structure. Its behavior is rather similar to the case where three men'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 454}, page_content='McCormac c14.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 8:40 P.M. Page 435\\n14.4 Limit Design 435\\nare walking along with a log on their shoulders and one of the men gets tired and lowers his\\nshoulder just a little. The result is a redistribution of loads to the other men and, thus, changes\\nin the shears and moments throughout the log.\\nIt might be well at this point to attempt to distinguish between the terms plasticd e sign as\\nused in structural steel and limitd e sign as used in reinforced concrete. In structural steel, plastic\\ndesign involves both (a) the increased resisting moment of a member after the extreme ﬁber\\nof the member is stressed to its yield point and (b) the redistribution or change in the moment\\npattern in the member. (Load and resistance factor design [LRFD] is a steel design method\\nthat incorporates much of the theory associated with plastic design.) In reinforced concrete, the\\nincrease in resisting moment of a section after part of the section has been stressed to its yield\\npoint has already been accounted for in the strength design procedure. Therefore, limit design\\nfor reinforced concrete structures is concerned only with the change in the moment pattern\\nafter the steel reinforcing at some cross section is stressed to its yield point.\\nThe basic assumption used for limit design of reinforced concrete structures and for\\nplastic design of steel structures is the ability of these materials to resist a so-called yield\\nmoment while an appreciable increase in local curvature occurs. In effect, if one section of\\na statically indeterminate member reaches this moment, it begins to yield but does not fail.\\nRather, it acts like a hinge (called a plastich inge) and throws the excess load off to sections\\nof the members that have lesser stresses. The resulting behavior is much like that of the log\\nsupported by three men when one man lowered his shoulder.\\nTo apply the limit design or plastic theory to a particular structure, it is necessary for\\nthat structure to behave plastically. For this initial discussion, it is assumed that an ideal plastic\\nmaterial, such as a ductile structural steel, is involved. Figure 14.4 shows the relationship of\\nmoment to the resulting curvature of a short length of a ductile steel member. The theoretical\\nultimate or nominal resisting moment of a section is referred to in this text as Mn (it’s the\\nsame as the plastic moment Mp ).\\nAlthough the moment-to-curvature relationship for reinforced concrete is quite different\\nfrom the ideal one pictured in Figure 14.4, the actual curve can be approximated reasonably\\nwell by the ideal one, as shown in Figure 14.5. The dashed line in the ﬁgure represents the\\nideal curve, while the solid line is a typical one for reinforced concrete. Tests have shown that\\nthe lower the reinforcing percentage in the concrete ρ or ρ − ρ′ (where ρ′ is the percentage\\nof compressive reinforcing), the closer will the concrete curve approach the ideal curve. This\\nis particularly true when very ductile reinforcing steels, such as Grade 40, are used. Should a\\nlarge percentage of steel be present in a reinforced concrete member, the yielding that actually\\noccurs before failure will be so limited that the ultimate or limit behavior of the member will\\nnot be greatly affected by yielding.\\nMoment\\nCurvature or rotation\\nMp = plastic moment = Mn\\nFIGURE 1 4 . 4 Moment–curvature relationship\\nfor an ideal plastic material.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 455}, page_content='McCormac c14.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 8:40 P.M.

A statically determinate beam will fail if one plastic hinge develops. To illustrate this\\nfact, the simple beam of constant cross section loaded with a concentrated load at midspan\\nshown in Figure 14.6(a) is considered. Should the load be increased until a plastic hinge is\\ndeveloped at the point of maximum moment (underneath the load in this case), an unstable\\nstructure will have been created, as shown in Figure 14.6(b). Any further increase in load will\\ncause collapse.\\nThe plastic theory is of little advantage for statically determinate beams and frames, but\\nit may be of decided advantage for statically indeterminate beams and frames. For a statically\\nindeterminate structure to fail, it is necessary for more than one plastic hinge to form. The\\nnumber of plastic hinges required for failure of statically indeterminate structures will be\\nFIGURE 1 4 . 6 Plastic hinge formation in a statically determinate beam.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 456}, page_content='McCormac c14.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 8:40 P.M.

The ﬁxed-end beam\\nof Figure 14.7 cannot fail unless the three plastic hinges shown in the ﬁgure are developed.\\nAlthough a plastic hinge may be formed in a statically indeterminate structure, the load\\ncan still be increased without causing failure if the geometry of the structure permits. The\\nplastic hinge will act like a real hinge insofar as increased loading is concerned. As the load\\nis increased, there is a redistribution of moment because the plastic hinge can resist no more\\nmoment. As more plastic hinges are formed in the structure, there will eventually be a sufﬁcient\\nnumber of them to cause collapse.\\nThe propped beam of Figure 14.8 is an example of a structure that will fail after two\\nplastic hinges develop. Three hinges are required for collapse, but there is a real hinge at the\\nright end. In this beam, the largest elastic moment caused by the design-concentrated load is at\\nthe ﬁxed end. As the magnitude of the load is increased, a plastic hinge will form at that point.\\nThe load may be further increased until the moment at some other point (here it will be\\nat the concentrated load) reaches the plastic moment. Add itional load will cause the beam to\\ncollapse. The arrangement of plastic hinges, and perhaps real hinges that permit collapse in a\\nstructure, is called themechanism. Parts (b) of Figures 14.6, 14.7, and 14.8 show mechanisms\\nfor various beams.\\nFIGURE 1 4 . 8 Plastic hinge formation in a propped can tilever\\nstatically indeterminate beam.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 457}, page_content='McCormac c14.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 8:40 P.M.

The\\nmethod of plastic analysis known as theequilibrium method will be illustrated in this section.\\nThe ﬁxed-end beam of Figure 14.9 is considered ﬁrst. It is desired to determine the\\nvalue of wn , the theoretical ultimate load the beam can support. The maximum moments in a\\nuniformly loaded ﬁxed-end beam in the elastic range occur at the ﬁxed ends, as shown in the\\nﬁgure.\\nIf the magnitude of the uniform load is increased, the moments in the beam will be\\nincreased proportionately until a plastic moment eventually develops at some point. B ecause\\nof symmetry, plastic moments will be developed at the beam ends, as shown in Figure 14.10(b).\\nShould the loads be further increased, the beam will be unable to resist moments larger thanMn\\nat its ends.

This increase is shown by the dashed line in Figure 14.11(b). The load\\ncan be increased until the moment at some other point (here the beam centerline) reaches the\\nplastic moment. When this happens, a third plastic hinge will have developed and a mechanism\\nwill have been created, permitting collapse.\\nOne method of determining the value of wn is to take moments at the centerline of the\\nbeam (knowing the moment there is Mn at collapse).

This point will be at the ﬁxed end,\\nwhere the elastic moment diagram has its largest ordinate.\\nAfter this plastic hinge is formed, the beam will act as though it is simply supported\\ninsofar as load increases are concerned, because it will have a plastic hinge at the left end and\\na real hinge at the right end.

Page 442\\n442 CHAPTER 1 4 Continuous Reinforced Concrete Structures\\n14.5 Limit Design under the ACI Code\\nTests of reinforced concrete frames have shown that under certain conditions, there is deﬁnitely\\na redistribution of moments before collapse occurs. Recognizing this fact, the ACI Code (8.4.1)\\npermits factored moments calculated by elastic theory ( not by an approx imate analysis)t ob e\\ndecreased at locations of maximum negative or positive moment in any span of a continuous\\nstructure for any loading arrangement. The amount by which moments can be decreased cannot\\nexceed 1000ϵt% with a maximum of 20%. Redistribution of moments as described herein is\\nnot permissible unless ϵt is equal to or greater than 0.0075 at the section where moment is\\nreduced (ACI Section 8.4.2). Appendix A, Table A.7 and Appendix B, Table B.7 of this book\\nprovide percentages of steel for which ϵt will be equal to 0.0075. If ρ is greater than these\\nvalues, redistribution is not permitted, b ecause ϵt will be less than 0.0075. The values given\\nin the table are for rectangular sections with tensile reinforcing.\\nAccording to ACI Section 18.10.4.1, negative or positive moments may be decreased for\\nprestressed sections, using the same rules, if bonded reinforcing (as described in Chapter 19\\nherein) is used.\\nThe ACI Code’s percentage of moment redistribution has purposely been limited to a\\nvery conservative value to be sure that excessively large concrete cracks do not occur at high\\nsteel stresses and to ensure adequate ductility for moment redistribution at the plastic hinges.\\nThe ACI Code likely will expand its presently conservative redistribution method after the\\nbehavior of plastic hinges is better understood, particularly in regard to shears, deﬂections, and\\ndevelopment of reinforcing. It is assumed here that the sections are satisfactorily reinforced\\nfor shears so that the ultimate moments can be r eached wit hout shear failure occurring. The\\nadjustments are applied to the moments resulting from each of the different loading conditions.\\nThe member in question will then be proportioned on the basis of the resulting moment\\nenvelope. Figures 14.15 through 14.18 illustrate the application of the moment redistribution\\npermitted by the code to a three-span continuous beam. It will be noted in these ﬁgures that\\nfactored loads and elastic analyses are used for all the calculations.\\nThree different live-load conditions are considered in these ﬁgures. To determine the\\nmaximum positive moment in span 1, the live load is pl aced in spans 1 and 3 (Figure 14.15).\\nSimilarly, to produce maximum positive moment in span 2, the live load is pl aced in that span\\nonly (Figure 14.16). Finally, maximum negative moment at the ﬁrst interior support from the\\nleft end is caused by placing the live load in spans 1 and 2 (Figure 14.17).\\nFor this particular beam, it is assumed that the code permits a 10% decrease in the\\nnegative or positive moments. This will require that 1000 ϵt exceed 10 at the sections where\\nthe moment is reduced to provide the needed ductility. The result will be smaller design\\nmoments at the critical sections. Initially, the loading for maximum positive moment in span 1\\nis considered as shown in Figure 14.15. If the maximum calculated positive moments of 425 ft-k\\nnear midspan of the end spans are each decreased by 10% to 383 ft-k, the negative moments\\nat both interior supports will be increased to 406 ft-k. Even though the negative moment has\\nincreased signiﬁcantly, from 308 ft-k to 406 ft-k, this higher value still will not control the\\nrequired moment capacity at this location. Hence, the positive design moment is decreased,\\nbut the negative moment is not increased.\\nIn the same fashion, in Figure 14.16, where the beam is loaded to produce maximum\\npositive moment in span 2, a 10% decrease in positive moment from 261 ft-k to 235 ft-k will\\nincrease the negative moment at both interior supports from 339 ft-k to 365 ft-k.\\nFinally, in Figure 14.17, the live-load placement causes a maximum negative moment at\\nthe ﬁrst interior support of 504 ft-k. If this value is reduced by 10%, the maximum moment\\nthere will be −454 ft-k. In this ﬁgure, the authors have reduced the negative moment at the\\nother interior support by 10% also.\\nIt will be noticed that the net result of all of the various decreases in the positive or\\nnegative moments is a net reduction in both the maximum positive and the maximum negative'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 462}, page_content='McCormac c14.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 8:40 P.M.

Even if a computer design is used, it is often economically advisable to\\nmake some preliminary estimates as to sizes. If an approximate analysis of the structure has\\nbeen made, it will be possible to make very reasonable member size estimates. The result will\\nbe appreciable saving of both computer time and money.\\nAn experienced designer can usually make very satisfactory preliminary size estimates\\nbased on previous experience. In the absence of such experience, however, the designer can still\\nmake quite reasonable size estimates based on knowledge of structural analysis. For instance,\\nto size columns approximately, a designer can neglect moments and assume an average axial\\nstress, or Pu /Ag , value of about 0.4 f ′\\nc to 0.6 f ′\\nc. This rough value can be divided into the\\nestimated column load to obtain its estimated area. If moments are large, lower values of\\naverage stress (0.4f ′\\nc to 0.5 f ′\\nc) can be used; if moments are small, higher values (0.55 f ′\\nc to\\n0.6f ′\\nc) can be used.\\nPreliminary beam sizes can be obtained by considering their approximate moments.\\nA uniformly loaded simple beam will have a maximum bending moment equal to wu l2/8,\\nwhereas a uniformly loaded ﬁxed-end beam will have a maximum moment of wu l2/12. For a\\ncontinuous uniformly loaded beam, the designer might very well estimate a maximum moment\\nsomewhere between the values given, perhapswu l2/10, and use that value to estimate the\\nbeam size.\\nFor many structures, it is necessary to conduct at least two different analyses. One\\nanalysis is made to consider the effect of gravity loads as described in Section 14.7 of this\\nchapter, while another might be made to consider the effect of lateral loads as discussed in\\nSection 14.8. For the gravity loads only,U usually equals 1.2 D + 1.6L.\\nBecause the gravity loads affect only the ﬂoor to which they are applied, each ﬂoor can\\nbe analyzed independently of the others. Such is not the case for lateral loads because lateral\\nloads applied anywhere on the frame affect the lateral displacements throughout the frame and,\\nthus, affect the forces in the frame below. For this situation, the load factor equations involving\\nlateral forces (ACI Equations 9-3, 9-4, etc.) must be applied.\\nSometimes a third analysis should be made—one that involves the possibility of force\\nreversals on the windward side or even overturning of the structure. If overturning is being\\nconsidered, the dead and live gravity loads should be reduced to their smallest possible values\\n(i.e., zero live load and 0.9D, in case the dead loads have been overestimated a little) while\\nthe lateral loads are acting. For this case, ACI load factor equations 9-6 and 9-7 must be\\nconsidered.\\n14.7 Approximate Analysis of Continuous Frames\\nfor Vertical Loads\\nStatically indeterminate structures may be analyzed “exactly” or “approximately.” Some\\napproximate methods involving the use of simplifying assumptions are presented in this\\nsection. Despite the increased use of computers for making “exact” analyses, approximate\\nmethods are used about as much or more than ever, for several reasons. These include the\\nfollowing:\\n1. The structure may be so complicated that no one who has the knowledge to make an\\n“exact” analysis is available or no suitable computer software is available.\\n2. For some structures, either method may be subject to so many errors and imperfections\\nthat approximate methods may yield values as accurate as those obtained with an “exact”\\nanalysis. A speciﬁc example is the analysis of a building frame for wind loads where'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 465}, page_content='McCormac c14.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 8:40 P.M. Page 446\\n446 CHAPTER 1 4 Continuous Reinforced Concrete Structures\\nthe walls, partitions, and ﬂoors contribute an indeterminate amount to wind resistance.\\nWind forces calculated in the frame by either method are not accurate.\\n3. To design the members of a statically indeterminate structure, it is sometimes necessary\\nto make an estimate of their sizes before structural analysis can begin by an exact\\nmethod. Approximate analysis of the structure will yield forces from which reasonably\\ngood initial estimates can be made as to member sizes.\\n4. Approximate analyses are quite useful in rough-checking exact solutions.\\nFrom the discussion of inﬂuence lines in Section 14.3, you can see that unless a com-\\nputer is used (a very practical alternative today), an exact analysis involving several different\\nplacements of the live loads would be a long and tedious affair. For this reason, it is common\\nwhen a computer is not readily available to use some approximate methods of analysis, such\\nas the ACI moment and shear coefﬁcients, the equivalent rigid-frame method, the assumed\\npoint-of-inﬂection-location method, and others discussed in the pages to follow.\\nACI Coefﬁcients for Continuous Beams and Slabs\\nA very common method used for the design of continuous reinforced concrete structures\\ninvolves the use of the ACI coefﬁcients given in Section 8.3.3 of the code. These coefﬁcients,\\nwhich are reproduced in Table 14.1, provide estimated maximum shears and moments for\\nbuildings of normal proportions. The values calculated in this manner will usually be somewhat\\nlarger than those that would be obtained with an “exact” analysis. As a result, appreciable\\neconomy can normally be obtained by taking the time or effort to make such an analysis. In\\nthis regard, it should be realized that these coefﬁcients are considered best applied to continuous\\nframes having more than three or four continuous spans.\\nTABLE 14. 1 ACI Coefﬁcients\\nPositive moment\\nEnd spans\\nIf discontinuous end is unrestrained 1\\n11 wul 2\\nn\\nIf discontinuous end is integral with the support 1\\n14 wul2\\nn\\nInterior spans 1\\n16 wul2\\nn\\nNegative moment at exterior face of ﬁrst interior support\\nTwo spans 1\\n9 wul2\\nn\\nMore than two spans 1\\n10 wul2\\nn\\nNegative moment at other faces of interior supports 1\\n11 wul2\\nn\\nNegative moment at face of all supports for (a) slabs with spans not\\nexceeding 10 ft and (b) beams and girders where ratio of sum of column\\nstiffnesses to beam stiffness exceeds eight at each end of the span\\n1\\n12 wul2\\nn\\nNegative moment at interior faces of exterior supports for members built\\nintegrally with their supports\\nWhere the support is a spandrel beam or girder 1\\n24 wul2\\nn\\nWhere the support is a column 1\\n16 wul2\\nn\\nShear in end members at face of ﬁrst interior support 1.15( wuln/2)\\nShear at face of all other supports wuln/2\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 466}, page_content='McCormac c14.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 8:40 P.M.

In addition, the values are not applicable to prestressed concrete members. Should these\\nlimitations not be met, a more precise method of analysis must be used.\\nFor the design of a continuous beam or slab, the moment coefﬁcients provide in effect\\ntwo sets of moment diagrams for each span of the structure. One diagram is the result of\\nplacing the live loads so that they will cause maximum positive moment out in the span, while\\nthe other is the result of placing the live loads so as to cause maximum negative moments\\nat the supports. To be truthful, however, it is not possible to produce maximum negative\\nmoments at both ends of a span simultaneously. It takes one placement of the live loads to\\nproduce maximum negative moment at one end of the span and another placement to produce\\nmaximum negative moment at the other end. The assumption of both maximums occurring at\\nthe same time is on the safe side, however, because the resu lting diagram will have greater\\ncritical values than are produced by either one of the two separate loading conditions.\\nThe ACI coefﬁcients give maximum points for a moment envelope for each span of a\\ncontinuous frame. Typical envelopes are shown in Figure 14.19 for a continuous slab, which\\nis assumed to be constructed integrally with its exterior supports, which are spandrel girders.\\nExample 14.1 presents the design of the slab of Figure 14.20 using the moment coefﬁ-\\ncients of the ACI Code.

Thus, they are analyzed purely as continuous\\nbeams, as shown in Figure 14.24. The girders do provide some torsional stiffness, and if the\\ncalculated torsional moments exceed φλ√\\nf ′c(A2\\ncp /ρcp) as speciﬁed in ACI Section 11.6.1, they\\nmust be considered, as will be described in Chapter 15.\\nWhere continuous beams frame into columns, the bending stiffnesses of the columns\\ntogether with the torsional stiffnesses of the girders are of such magnitude that they must be\\nconsidered. An approximate method frequently used for analyzing such reinforced concrete\\nmembers is the equivalent rigid-frame method . In this method, which is applicable only to\\ngravity loads, the loads are assumed to be applied only to the ﬂoor or roof under consideration\\nand the far ends of the columns are assumed to be ﬁxed, as shown in Figure 14.25. The sizes\\nof the members are estimated, and an analysis is frequently made with moment distribution.\\nFor this type of analysis, it is necessary to estimate the sizes of the members and compute\\ntheir relative stiffness, or I /l, values. From these values, distribution factors can be computed\\nand the method of moment distribution applied. The moments of inertia of both columns and\\nbeams are normally calculated on the basis of gross concrete sections, with no allowance made\\nfor reinforcing.\\nThere is a problem involved in determining the moment of inertia to be used for con-\\ntinuous T beams. The moment of inertia of a T beam is much greater where there is positive\\nmoment with the ﬂanges in compression than where there is negative moment with the ﬂanges\\ncracked because of tension. Because the moment of inertia varies along the span, it is necessary\\nto use an equivalent value. A practice often used is to assume that the equivalent moment of\\ninertia equals twice the moment of inertia of the web, assuming that the web depth equals\\nthe full effective depth of the beam. 5 Some designers use other equivalent values, such as\\nassuming an equivalent T section with ﬂanges of effective widths equal to so many (say, two\\nto six) times the web width. These equivalent sections can be varied over a rather wide range\\nwithout appreciably affecting the ﬁnal moments.\\nF I G U R E 14.24Continuous with only vertical support.\\nF I G U R E 14.25Continuous with both vertical and rotational support.\\n5 Portland Cement Association, 1959, Continuity in Concrete Building Frames , 4th ed.

These are (1) live load placed on two adjacent spans\\nand (2) live load placed on alternate spans. Example 14.2 illustrates the application of the\\nequivalent rigid-frame method to a continuous T beam.\\nComputer results appear to indicate that the model shown in Figure 14.25 (as permitted\\nby the ACI Code) may not be trustworthy for unsymmetrical loading. Differential column\\nshortening can completely redistribute the moments obtained from the model (i.e., positive\\nmoments can become negative moments).

Such assumptions have the effect of\\ncreating simple beams between the points of inﬂection in each span, and the positive moments\\nin each span can be determined by statics. Negative moments occur in the girders between\\ntheir ends and the points of inﬂection. They may be computed by considering the portion of\\neach beam out to the point of inﬂection (P.I.) to be a can tilever. The shear at the end of each\\nof the girders contributes to the axial forces in the columns. Similarly, the negative moments\\nat the ends of the girders are transferred to the columns.\\nIn Figure 14.29, beam AB of the building frame shown is analyzed by assuming points\\nof inﬂection at the one-ﬁfth points and assuming ﬁxed supports at the beam ends.\\n14.8 Approximate Analysis of Continuous Frames\\nfor Lateral Loads\\nBuilding frames are subjected to lateral loads as well as to vertical loads. The necessity for\\ncareful attention to these forces increases as buildings become taller. Buildings must not only\\nhave sufﬁcient lateral resistance to prevent failure, but also must have sufﬁcient resistance to\\ndeﬂections to prevent injuries to their variousparts. Rigid-frame buildings are highly statically\\nindeterminate; their analysis by “exact” methods (unless computers are used) is so lengthy as\\nto make the approximate methods very popular.\\nThe approximate method presented here is called the portal method . Because of its\\nsimplicity, it has probably been used more than any other approximate method for determining\\nwind forces in building frames. This method, which was presented by Albert Smith in the\\nJournal of the Western Society of Engineersin April 1915, is said to be satisfactory for most\\nbuildings up to 25 stories in height. Another m ethod very similar to the portal method is the\\nCourtesy of EFCO Corp.\\nThe 16-story Apoquindo Tower, Santiago, Chile.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 474}, page_content='McCormac c14.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 8:40 P.M.

It is thought to give slightly better results for high narrow buildings and\\ncan be used for buildings not in excess of 25 to 35 stories. 6\\nThe portal method is merely a variation of the method described in Section 14.7 for\\nanalyzing beams in which the location of the points of inﬂection was assumed. For the portal\\nmethod, the loads are assumed to be applied at the joints only. If this loading condition is\\ncorrect, the moments will vary linearly in the members, and points of inﬂection will be located\\nfairly close to member midpoints.\\nNo consideration is given in the portal method to the elastic properties of the members.\\nThese omissions can be very serious in unsymmetrical frames and in very tall buildings. To\\nillustrate the seriousness of the matter, the changes in member sizes are considered in a very\\ntall building. In such a building, there will probably not be a great deal of change in beam\\nsizes from the top ﬂoor to the bottom ﬂoor. For the same loadings and spans, the changed\\nsizes would be the result of the large wind moments in the lower ﬂoors. The change in column\\nsizes from top to bottom, however, would be tremendous. The result is that the relative sizes\\nof columns and beams on the top ﬂoors are entirely different from the relative sizes on the\\nlower ﬂoors. When this fact is not considered, it causes large errors in the analysis.\\nIn the portal method, the entire wind loads are assumed to be resisted by the building\\nframes, with no stiffening assistance from the ﬂoors, walls, and partitions. Changes in the\\nlengths of girders and columns are assumed to be negligible. They are not negligible, however,\\nin tall slender buildings, the height of which is ﬁve or more times the least horizontal dimension.\\nIf the height of a building is roughly ﬁve or more times its least lateral dimension, it\\nis generally felt that a more precise method of analysis should be used. There are several\\napproximate methods that make use of the elastic properties of structures and give values\\nclosely approaching the results of the“exact” methods. These include the factor method, 7 the\\nWitmer method of K percentages, and the Spurr method. 8\\nThe building frame shown in Figure 14.30 is analyzed by the portal method, as described\\nin the following paragraphs.\\nAt least three assumptions must be made for each individual portal or for each girder. In\\nthe portal method, the frame is theoretically divided into independent portals (Figure 14.31),\\nand the following three assumptions are made:\\n1. The columns bend in such a manner that there is a point of inﬂection at middepth.\\n2. The girders bend in such a manner that there is a point of inﬂection at their centerlines.\\n3. The horizontal shears on each level are arbitrarily distributed between the columns. One\\ncommonly used distribution (and the one illustrated here) is to assume that the shear\\ndivides among the columns in the ratio of one part to exterior columns and two parts to\\ninterior columns.\\nThe reason for the ratio in assumption 3 can be seen in Figure 14.31. Each of the interior\\ncolumns is serving two bents, whereas the exterior columns are serving only one. Another\\ncommon distribution is to assume that the shear, V, taken by each column is in pr oportion to\\nthe ﬂoor area it supports. The shear distribution by the two procedures would be the same for\\na building with equal bays, but for one with unequal bays the results would differ, with the\\nﬂoor area method probably giving more realistic results.\\n6 “Wind Bracing in Steel Buildings, ” 1940, Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers , 105, pp. 1723–1727.\\n7 Norris, C.

You can visualize the stress condition of the frame if you assume that the wind is\\ntending to push it over from left to right, stretching the left exterior columns and compressing\\nthe right exterior columns. Brieﬂy, the calculations were made as follows:\\n1. Column shears —The shears in each column on the various levels were obtained ﬁrst.\\nThe total shear on the top level is 15 k. Because there are two exterior and two interior\\ncolumns, the following expression may be written:\\nx + 2x + 2x + x = 15 k\\nx = 2.5 k\\n2x = 5.0 k\\nThe shear in column CD is 2.5 k, in GH it is 5.0 k, and so on.

Column moments—The columns are assumed to have points of inﬂection at their mid-\\ndepths; therefore, their moments, top and bottom, equal the column shears times half\\nthe column heights.\\n3. Girder moments and shears —At any joint in the frame, the sum of the moments in the\\ngirders equals the sum of the moments in the columns. The column moments have been\\npreviously determined. Beginning at the upper-left corner of the frame and working\\nacross from left to right, adding or subtracting the moments as the case may be, the\\ngirder moments were found in this order: DH, HL, LP, CG, GK, and so on. It follows\\nthat with points of inﬂection at girder centerlines, the girder shears equal the girder\\nmoments divided by half-girder lengths.\\n4. Column axial forces—The axial forces in the columns may be directly obtained from the\\ngirder shears. Starting at the upper-left corner, the column axial force in CD is equal to\\nthe shear in girder DH. The axial force in column GH is equal to the difference between\\nthe two girder shears DH and HL, which equals zero in this case. (If the width of each\\nof the portals is the same, the shears in the girder on one level will be equal and the\\ninterior columns will have no axial force, since only lateral loads are considered.)\\n14.9 Computer Analysis of Building Frames\\nAll structures are three-dimensional, but theoretical analyses of such structures by hand cal-\\nculation methods are so lengthy as to be impractical. As a result, such systems are normally\\nassumed to consist of two-dimensional or planar systems, and they are analyzed independently\\nof each other. The met hods of analysis presented in this chapter were handled in this manner.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 478}, page_content='McCormac c14.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 8:40 P.M. Page 459\\n14.11 Development Length Requirements for Continuous Members 459\\nToday’s computers have greatly changed the picture, and it is now possible to analyze\\ncomplete three-dimensional structures. As a result, more realistic analyses are available, and\\nthe necessity for high safety factors is reduced. The application of computers is not restricted\\nmerely to analysis; they are used in almost every phase of concrete work from analysis to\\ndesign to detailing to speciﬁcation writing to material take-offs to cost estimating and so on.\\nAnother major advantage of computer analysis for building frames is that the designer\\nis able to consider many different loading patterns quickly. The results are sometimes rather\\nsurprising.\\n14.10 Lateral Bracing for Buildings\\nFor the usual building, the designer will select relatively small columns. Although such a pro-\\ncedure results in more ﬂoor space, it also results in buildings with small lateral stiffnesses or\\nresistance to wind and earthquake loads. Such buildings may have detrimental lateral deﬂec-\\ntions and vibrations during windstorms unless deﬁnite lateral stiffness or bracing is otherwise\\nprovided in the structure.\\nTo provide lateral stiffness, it is n ecessary for the roof and ﬂoor slabs to be attached to\\nrigid walls, stairwells, or elevator shafts. Sometimes structural walls, called shear walls,a r e\\nadded to a structure to provide the n ecessary lateral resistance. (The design of shear walls is\\nconsidered in Chapter 18 of this text.) If it is not possible to provide such walls, stairwells\\nor elevator shafts may be designed as large, box-shaped beams to transmit lateral loads to the\\nsupporting foundations. These members will behave as large cantilever beams. In designing\\nsuch members, the designer should try to keep resistance symmetrical so as to prevent uneven\\nlateral twisting or torsion in the structure when lateral loads are applied.9\\n14.11 Development Length Requirements\\nfor Continuous Members\\nIn Chapter 7, a general introduction to the subject of development lengths for simple and\\ncantilever beams was presented. This section examines the ACI development length require-\\nments for continuous members for both positive and negative reinforcing. After studying this\\ninformation, the reader probably will be pleased to ﬁnd at the end of this section a discussion\\nof simpliﬁed design ofﬁce practices for determining bar lengths.\\nPositive-Moment Reinforcement\\nSection 12.11 of the code provides several detailed requirements for the lengths of positive-\\nmoment reinforcement. These are brieﬂy summarized in the following paragraphs.\\n1. At least one-third of the positive steel in simple beams and one-fourth of the positive steel\\nin continuous members must extend uninterrupted along the same face of the member\\nat least 6 in. in the support (12.11.1). The purpose of this requirement is to make sure\\nthat the moment resistance of a beam will not be reduced excessively in parts of beams\\nwhere the moments may be changed due to settlements, lateral loads, and so on.\\n2. The positive reinforcement required in the pr eceding paragraph must, if the member is\\npart of a primary lateral load resisting system , be extended into the support a sufﬁcient\\ndistance to develop the yield stress in tension of the bars at the face of the support. This\\nrequirement is included by the code (12.11.2) to ensure a ductile response to severe\\noverstress, as might occur with moment reversal during an earthquake or explosion.\\nAs a result of this requirement, it is necessary to have bottom bars lapped at interior\\nsupports and to use additional embedment lengths and hooks at exterior supports.\\n9 Leet, K., 1991, Reinforced Concrete Design, 2nd ed. (New Y ork: McGraw-Hill), pp. 453–454.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 479}, page_content='McCormac c14.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 8:40 P.M. Page 460\\n460 CHAPTER 1 4 Continuous Reinforced Concrete Structures\\n3. Section 12.11.3 of the code says that at simple supports and at points of inﬂection,\\nthe positive-moment tension bars must have their diameters limited to certain maximum\\nsizes. The purpose of the limitation is to keep bond stresses within reason at these points\\nof low moments and large shears. (It is to be remembered that when bar diameters are\\nsmaller, the bars have greater surface area in proportion to their cross-sectional areas.\\nThus, for bonding to concrete, the larger the bars’ diameters, the larger must be their\\ndevelopment lengths. This fact is reﬂected in the expressions for ld .) It has not been\\nshown that long anchorage lengths are fully effective in developing bars in a short\\ndistance between a P.I. and a point of maximum bar stress, a condition that might occur\\nin heavily loaded short beams with large bottom bars. It is speciﬁed that ld as computed\\nby the requirements presented in Chapter 7 may not exceed the following:\\nld ≤ Mn\\nVu\\n+ la (ACI Equation 12-5)\\nIn this expression, Mn is the computed theoretical ﬂexural strength of the member\\nif all reinforcing in that part of the beam is assumed stressed to fy ,a n d Vu is the\\nfactored shear at the section. At a support, la is equal to the sum of the embedment\\nlength beyond the centerline of the support and the equivalent embedment length of any\\nfurnished hooks or mechanical anchorage. Headed and mechanically anchored deformed\\nbars, which are permitted in Section 12.6 of the ACI Code, consist of bars or plates\\nor angles or other pieces welded or otherwise attached transversely to the ﬂexural bars\\nin locations where sufﬁcient anchorage length is not available. See Sections 1.15 and\\n7.15 of this text for details on headed anchorage. At a point of inﬂection,la is equal to\\nthe larger of the effective depth of the member or 12 d (ACI 12.11.3). When the ends\\nof the reinforcement are conﬁned by a compression reaction, such as when there is a\\ncolumn below but not when a beam frames into a girder, an increase of 30% in the\\nvalue Mn /Vu to 1.3 Mn /Vu is allowed. The values described here are summarized in\\nFigure 14.33, which is similar to Figure R12.11.3 of the ACI Code.

Section 12.12.3 of the code says that at least one-third of the total\\nreinforcement provided for negative moment at the support must have an embedment length\\nbeyond the point of inﬂection no less than the effective depth of the member, 12 bar diameters,\\nor one-sixteenth of the clear span of the member, whichever is greatest.

Page 470\\nCHAPTER 1 5\\n Torsion\\n15.1 Introduction\\nThe average designer probably does not worry about torsion very much. He or she thinks almost\\nexclusively of axial forces, shears, and bending moments, and yet most reinforced concrete\\nstructures are subject to some degree of torsion. Until recent years, the safety factors required\\nby codes for the design of reinforced concrete members for shear, moment, and so forth were\\nso large that the effects of torsion could be safely neglected in all but the most extreme cases.\\nToday, however, overall safety factors are less than they used to be and members are smaller,\\nwith the result that torsion is a more common problem.\\nAppreciable torsion does occur in many structures, such as in the main girders of bridges,\\nwhich are twisted by transverse beams or slabs. It occurs in buildings where the edge of a ﬂoor\\nslab and its beams are supported by a spandrel beam running between the exterior columns.\\nThis situation is illustrated in Figure 15.1, where the ﬂoor beams tend to twist the spandrel\\nbeam laterally. Earthquakes can cause dangerous torsional forces in all buildings. This is\\nparticularly true in asymmetrical structures, where the centers of mass and rigidity do not\\ncoincide. Other cases where torsion may be signiﬁcant are in curved bridge girders, spiral\\nstairways, and balcony girders, and whenever large loads are applied to any beam “off center.”\\nAn off-center case where torsional stress can be very large is illustrated in Figure 15.2. It\\nshould be realized that if the supporting member is able to rotate, the resulting torsional\\nstresses will be fairly small. If, however, the member is restrained, the torsional stresses can be\\nquite large.\\nFIGURE 1 5 . 1 Torsion in spandrel beams.\\n470'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 490}, page_content='McCormac c15.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:21 P.M. Page 471\\n15.2 Torsional Reinforcing 471\\nFIGURE 1 5 . 2 Off-center loads causing torsion in main beam.\\nShould a plain concrete member be subjected to pure torsion, it will crack and fail along\\n45◦ spiral lines because of the dia gonal tension corresponding to the torsional stresses. For a\\nvery effective demonstration of this type of failure, you can take a piece of chalk in your hands\\nand twist it until it breaks. Although the diagonal tension stresses produced by twisting are\\nvery similar to those caused by shear, they will occur on all faces of a member. As a result,\\nthey add to the stresses caused by shear on one side and subtract from them on the other.1\\nRecently, there have been more reports of structural failures attributed to torsion. As a\\nresult, a rather large amount of research has been devoted to the subject, and thus there is\\na much-improved understanding of the behavior of structural members subjected to torsion.\\nOn the basis of this rather extensive experimental work, the ACI Code includes very speciﬁc\\nrequirements for the design of reinforced concrete members subjected to torsion or to torsion\\ncombined with shear and bending. It should be realized that maximum shears and torsional\\nforces may occur in areas where bending moments are small. For such cases, the interaction\\nof shear and torsion can be particularly important as it relates to design.\\n15.2 Torsional Reinforcing\\nReinforced concrete members subjected to large torsional forces may fail quite suddenly if\\nthey are not specially provided with torsional reinforcing. The addition of torsional reinforcing\\ndoes not change the magnitude of the torsion that will cause diagonal tension cracks, but it\\ndoes prevent the members from tearing apart. As a result, they will be able to resist substantial\\ntorsional moments without failure. Tests have shown that both longitudinal bars and closed\\nstirrups (or spirals) are necessary to intercept the numerous diagonal tension cracks that occur\\non all surfaces of members subject to appreciable torsional forces.\\nThe normal ⊔ -shaped stirrups are not satisfactory. They must be closed either by welding\\ntheir ends together to form a continuous loop, as illustrated in Figure 15.3(a), or by bending\\ntheir ends around a longitudinal bar, as shown in part (b) of the same ﬁgure. If one-piece\\nstirrups such as these are used, the entire beam cage may have to be prefabricated and placed\\nas a unit (and that may not be feasible if the longitudinal bars have to be passed between\\ncolumn bars) or the longitudinal bars will have to be threaded one by one through the closed\\nstirrups and perhaps the column bars. It is easy to see that some other arrangement is usually\\ndesirable.\\n1 White, R. N., Gergely, P., and Sexsmith, R.

Although this arrangement simpliﬁes the pl acement of longitudinal bars,\\nit has not proved very satisfactory. As described in the ACI Commentary (R11.5.4.1), members\\nprimarily subjected to torsion lose their concrete side cover by spalling at high torques. Should\\nthis happen, the lapped spliced ⊔ stirrups of Figure 15.4 will prove ineffective, and premature\\ntorsion failure may occur.\\nA much better type of torsion reinforcement consists of ⊔ stirrups, each with a properly\\nanchored top bar, such as the ones shown in Figure 15.5. It has been proved by testing that the use\\nof torsional stirrups with 90◦ hooks results in spalling of the concrete outside the hooks. The use\\nof 135◦ hooks for both the ⊔ stirrups and the top bars is very helpful in reducing this spalling.\\nShould lateral conﬁnement of the stirrups be provided as shown in parts (b) and (c) of\\nFigure 15.5, the 90 ◦ hooks will be satisfactory for the top bars.\\nShould beams with wide webs (say, 2 ft or more) be used, it is common to use multiple-\\nleg stirrups. For such situations, the outer stirrup legs will be proportioned for both shear and\\ntorsion, while the interior legs will be designed to take only vertical shear.\\nFIGURE 1 5 . 5 Recommended\\ntorsion reinforcement.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 493}, page_content='McCormac c15.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:21 P.M. Page 474\\n474 CHAPTER 1 5 Torsion\\nThe strength of closed stirrups cannot be developed unless additional longitudinal rein-\\nforcing is supplied. Longitudinal bars should be sp aced uniformly ar ound the insides of the\\nstirrups, not more than 12 in. apart. There must be at least one bar in each corner of the stirrups\\nto provide anchorage for the stirrup legs (Code 11.6.6.2); otherwise, if the concrete inside the\\ncorners were to be crushed, the stirrups would slip and the result would be even larger torsional\\ncracks. These longitudinal bars must have diameters at least equal to 0.042 times the stirrup\\nspacing. Their size may not be less than #3.\\n15.3 Torsional Moments that Have to\\nBe Considered in Design\\nThe reader is well aware from his or her studies of structural analysis that if one part of a\\nstatically indeterminate structure “gives” when a particular force is applied to that part, the\\namount of force that the part will have to resist will be appreciably reduced. For instance, if\\nthree men are walking along with a log on their shoulders (a statically indeterminate situation)\\nand one of them lowers his shoulder a little under the load, there will be a major redistribution\\nof the internal forces in the “structure” and a great deal less load for him to support. On\\nthe other hand, if two men are walking along with a log on their shoulders (a statically\\ndeterminate situation) and one of them lowers his shoulder slightly, there will be little change\\nin force distribution in the structure. These are similar to the situations that occur in statically\\ndeterminate and indeterminate structures subject to torsional moments. They are referred to\\nrespectively asequilibrium torsion and compatibility torsion.\\n1. Equilibrium torsion —For a statically determinate structure, there is only one path along\\nwhich a torsional moment can be transmitted to the supports. This type of torsional moment,\\nw h i c hi sr e f e r r e dt oa sequilibrium torsion or statically determinate torsion , cannot be\\nreduced by a redistribution of internal forces or by a rotation of the member. Equilibrium\\ntorsion is illustrated in Figure 15.6, which shows an edge beam supporting a concrete\\ncanopy. The edge beam must be designed to resist the full calculated torsional moment.\\n2. Compatibility torsion—The torsional moment in a particular part of a statically indeter-\\nminate structure may be substantially reduced if that part of the structure cracks under\\nthe torsion and “gives,” or rotates. The result will be a redistribution of forces in the\\nstructure. This type of torsion, which is illustrated in Figure 15.7, is referred to as\\nstatically indeterminate torsionor compatibility torsion, in the sense that the part of the\\nstructure in question twists in order to keep the deformations of the structure compatible.\\nDesign torque may\\nnot be reduced because\\nmoment redistribution\\nis not possible.\\nFIGURE 1 5 . 6 Equilibrium torsion.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 494}, page_content='McCormac c15.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:21 P.M.

In the expression to follow, Acp is the area\\nenclosed by the outside perimeter of the concrete cross section and pcp is the outside perimeter\\nof that cross section. It is assumed that torsional cracking will occur when the principal tension\\nstress reaches the tensile strength of the concrete in biaxial tension-compression.

Consequently, the torsional\\nmoment used for design in the spandrel beam can be reduced.\\n15.4 Torsional Stresses\\nAs previously mentioned, the torsional stresses add to the shear stresses on one side of a\\nmember and subtract from them on the other. This situation is illustrated for a hollow beam\\nin Figure 15.8.\\nTorsional stresses are quite low near the center of a solid beam. Because of this, hollow\\nbeams (assuming the wall thicknesses meet certain ACI requirements) are assumed to have\\nalmost exactly the same torsional strengths as solid beams with the same outside dimensions.\\nIn solid sections, the shear stresses due to the torsion, Tu , are concentrated in an outside\\n“tube” of the member, a shown in Figure 15.9(a), while the shear stresses resulting from Vu\\nare spread across the width of the solid section, as shown in part (b) of the ﬁgure. As a result,\\nthe two types of shear stresses (those from shear and torsion) are combined, using a square\\nroot expression shown in the next section of this chapter.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 495}, page_content='McCormac c15.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:21 P.M.

The\\ntorsion cracks tend to spiral around members (hollow or solid) located at approximately 45 ◦\\nangles with the longitudinal edges of those members. Torsion is assumed to be resisted by an\\nimaginary space truss located in the outer “tube” of concrete of the member. Such a truss is\\nshown in Figure 15.10. The longitudinal steel in the corners of the member and the closed\\ntransverse stirrups act as tension members in the “truss,” while the diagonal concrete between\\nthe stirrups acts as struts of compression members. The cracked concrete is still capable of\\ntaking compression stresses.\\n15.5 When Torsional Reinforcing Is Required by the ACI\\nThe design of reinforced concrete members for torsion is based on a thin-walled tube space\\ntruss analogy in which the inside or core concrete of the members is neglected. After torsion\\nhas caused a member to crack, its resistance to torsion is provided almost entirely by the closed\\nstirrups and the longitudinal reinforcing located near the member surface. Once cracking occurs,\\nthe concrete is assumed to have negligible torsional strength left. (This is not the case in shear\\ndesign, where the concrete is assumed to carry the same amount of shear as it did before\\ncracking.)\\nIf torsional stresses are less than about one-fourth of the cracking torque, Tcr , of a mem-\\nber, they will not appreciably reduce either its shear or ﬂexural strengths. Torsional cracking\\nis assumed to occur when the principal tensile stress reaches 4 λ\\n√\\nf ′c.

(If the computed torque for a particular member is larger than the preceding value,\\nthe preceding value may be used in design.) S hould the torsional moments be reduced as\\ndescribed here, it will be necessary to redistribute these moments to adjoining members. The\\nACI Commentary (R11.5.2.1 and R11.5.2.2) does say that when the layout of structures is\\nsuch as to impose signiﬁcant torsional rotations within a short length of a member (as where\\na large torque is located near a stiff column), a more exact analysis should be used.\\nFor isolated members with or without ﬂanges, Acp equals the area of the entire cross\\nsections (including the area of any voids in hollow members), and pcp represents the perimeters\\nof the entire cross sections. Should a beam be cast monolithically with a slab, the values of Acp\\nand pcp may be assumed to include part of the adjacent slabs of the resu lting T- or L-shaped\\nsections. The widths of the slabs that may be included as parts of the beams are described\\nin ACI Section 13.2.4 and illustrated in Figure 15.11. Those widths or extensions may not\\nexceed the projections of the beams a bove or below the slab or four times the slab thickness,\\nwhichever is smaller.\\nWhen appreciable torsion is present, it may be more economical to select a larger beam\\nthan would normally be selected so that torsion reinforcing does not have to be used.

On other occasions, such a practice\\nmay not be economical, and sometimes architectural considerations may dictate the use of\\nsmaller sections.\\n15.6 Torsional Moment Strength\\nThe sizes of members subject to shear and torsion are limited by the ACI Code so that unsightly\\ncracking is reduced and crushing of the surface concrete caused by inclined compression\\nstresses is prevented.

If the factored torsional moment\\nfor a particular member is larger than the value given in ACI Section 11.5.1 [φλ\\n√\\nf ′c\\n(A2\\ncp /Ph\\n⎡],\\nthe code provides an expression to compute the absolute minimum area of transverse closed\\nstirrups that may be used.\\n(Av + 2At ) = 0.75\\n√\\nf ′c\\nbw s\\nfyt\\n≥ 50bw s\\nfyt\\n(ACI Equation 11-23)\\nIn this expression, Av is the area of reinforcing required for shear in a distance s (which\\nrepresents the stirrup spacing). You will remember from shear design that the area Av obtained\\nis for both legs of a two-legged stirrup (or for all legs of a four-legged stirrup, etc.). The\\nvalue At , which represents the area of the stirrups needed for torsion, is for only one leg of\\nthe stirrup. Therefore, the value Av + 2At is the total area of both legs of the stirrup (for two-\\nlegged stirrups) needed for shear plus torsion. It is considered desirable to use equal volumes\\nof steel in the stirrups and the added longitudinal steel so that they will participate equally in\\nresisting torsional moments. This theory was followed in preparing the ACI equations used\\nfor selecting torsional reinforcing. The ACI Code requires that the area of stirrups At used for\\nresisting torsion be computed with the equation that follows:\\nTn =\\n2Ao At fyt\\ns cot θ (ACI Equation 11-21)\\nThis equation is usually written in the following form:\\nAt\\ns = Tn\\n2Ao fyt cot θ\\nThe transverse reinforcing is based on the torsional moment strength, Tn , which equals\\nTu /φ.T h et e r mAo represents the gross area enclosed by the shear ﬂow path around the perime-\\nter of the tube. This area is deﬁned in terms of Aoh , which is the area enclosed by the outermost\\nclosed hoops. Figure 15.12 illustrates this deﬁnition of Aoh for several beam cross sections.\\nThe value of Ao may be determined by analysis, or it may be taken as 0.85 Aoh .T h et e r m\\nθ represents the angle of the concrete “compression diagonals” in the analogous space truss.

In ACI Section 11.5.3.6, the value of θ may be 45 ◦ for nonprestressed\\nmembers, and that practice is followed herein. Suggested θ values for prestressed concrete are\\ngiven in this same ACI section.\\nAs given in the ACI Commentary (R11.5.3.8), the required stirrup areas for shear and\\ntorsion are added together as follows for a two-legged stirrup:\\nTotal\\n(Av+t\\ns\\n⎡\\n= Av\\ns + 2At\\ns\\nThe spacing of transverse torsional reinforcing may not be larger than ph /8o r1 2i n . ,\\nwhere ph is the perimeter of the centerline of the outermost closed transverse reinforcing (ACI\\n11.5.6.1). Remember also the maximum spacings of stirrups for shear d/2a n d d/4 given in\\nACI Sections 11.4.5.1 and 11.4.5.3.\\nIt has been found that reinforced concrete specimens with less than about 1% torsional\\nreinforcing by volume that are loaded in pure torsion fail as soon as torsional cracking occurs.\\nThe percentage is smaller for members subject to both torsion and shear. The equation to\\nfollow, which provides a minimum total area of longitudinal torsional reinforcing, is based on\\nusing about 0.5% torsional reinforcing by volume. In this expression, Acp is the area enclosed\\nby the outside concrete cross section. The value At /s may not be taken as less than 25 bw /fyv ,\\naccording to ACI Section 11.5.5.3.\\nAl min =\\n5\\n√\\nf ′cAcp\\nfy\\n−\\n(At\\ns\\n⎡\\nph\\nfyt\\nfy\\n(ACI Equation 11-24)\\nACI Section 11.5.4.3 states the longitudinal torsion reinforcement must be developed at\\nboth ends.\\nMaximum torsion generally acts at the ends of beams, and as a result the longitudinal\\ntorsion bars should be anchored for their yield strength at the face of the supports. To do this,\\nit may be necessary to use hooks or horizontal ⊔ -shaped bars lap spliced with the longitudinal\\ntorsion reinforcing. A rather common practice is to extend the bottom reinforcing in spandrel\\nbeams subjected to torsion 6 in . into the supports. Usually this is insufﬁcient .\\n15.8 Additional ACI Requirements\\nBefore we present numerical examples for torsion design, it is necessary to list several other\\nACI requirements. These are:\\n1. Sections located at a distance less than d from the face of support may be designed for\\nthe torque at a distance d. Should, however, a concentrated torque be present within this\\ndistance, the critical design section will be at the face of the support (ACI 11.5.2.4).\\n2. The design yield strength of torsion reinforcing for nonprestressed members may not\\nbe greater than 60,000 psi. The purpose of this maximum value is to limit the width of\\ndiagonal cracks (ACI 11.5.3.4).\\n3. The longitudinal tension created by torsion moments is partly offset in the ﬂexural com-\\npression zones of members. In these zones, the computed area of longitudinal torsional\\nreinforcing may be reduced by an amount equal to Mu /0.9dfy, according to ACI Section\\n11.5.3.9. In this expression, Mu is the factored moment acting at the section in combi-\\nnation with Tu . The reinforcing provided, however, may not be less than the minimum\\nvalues required in ACI Sections 11.5.5.3 and 11.5.6.2.\\n4. The longitudinal reinforcing must be distributed around the inside perimeter of the closed\\nstirrups and must be spaced no farther apart than 12 in. At least one bar must be placed\\nin each corner of the stirrups to provide anchorage for the stirrup legs. These bars have'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 499}, page_content='McCormac c15.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 10:21 P.M.

Torsional reinforcing must be provided for a distance no less than bt + d beyond the\\npoint where it is theoretically no longer required. The term bt represents the width of\\nthat part of the member cross section which contains the closed torsional stirrups (ACI\\n11.5.6.3).\\n15.9 Example Problems Using U.S. Customary Units\\nIn this section, the design of torsional reinforcing for a beam is presented using U.S. customary\\nunits; an example using SI units is presented in the next section.\\nExample 15.1\\nDesign the torsional reinforcing needed for the beam shown in Figure 15.13 iff′\\nc = 4000 psi,\\nfy = 60,000 psi, Tu = 30 ft-k, and Vu = 60 k.

Page 492\\nCHAPTER 1 6\\n Two-Way Slabs, Direct\\nDesign Method\\n16.1 Introduction\\nIn general, slabs are classiﬁed as being one way or two way. Slabs that primarily deﬂect in one\\ndirection are referred to as one-way slabs; see Figure 16.1(a). Simple-span, one-way slabs have\\nbeen discussed previously in Section 4.7 of this text, while the design of continuous one-way\\nslabs was considered in Section 14.7. When slabs are supported by columns arranged generally\\nin rows so that the slabs can deﬂect in two directions, they are usually referred to as two-way\\nslabs.\\nTwo-way slabs can be strengthened by the addition of beams between the columns, by\\nthickening the slabs around the columns ( drop panels), and by ﬂaring the columns under the\\nslabs (column capitals). These situations are shown in Figure 16.1 and discussed in the next\\nseveral paragraphs.\\nFlat plates, Figure 16.1(b), are solid concrete slabs of uniform depths that transfer loads\\ndirectly to the supporting columns without the aid of beams or capitals or drop panels. Flat\\nplates can be constructed quickly because of their simple formwork and reinforcing bar arrange-\\nments. They need the smallest overall story heights to provide speciﬁed headroom requirements,\\nand they give the most ﬂexibility in the arrangement of columns and partitions. They also pro-\\nvide little obstruction to light and have high ﬁre resistance b ecause there are few sharp corners\\nwhere spalling of the concrete might occur. Flat plates are probably the most commonly used\\nslab system today for multistory reinforced concrete hotels, motels, apartment houses, hospitals,\\nand dormitories.\\nFlat plates present a possible problem in transferring the shear at the perimeter of the\\ncolumns. In other words, there is a danger that the columns may punch through the slabs.\\nAs a result, it is frequently necessary to increase column sizes or slab thicknesses or to use\\nshearheads. Shearheads consist of steel I or channel shapes placed in the slab over the columns,\\nas discussed in Section 16.5 of this chapter. Although such procedures may seem expensive,\\nthe simple formwork required for ﬂat plates will usually result in such economical construction\\nthat the extra costs required for shearheads are more than canceled. For heavy industrial loads\\nor long spans, however, some other type of ﬂoor system may be required.\\nFlat slabs , shown in Figure 16.1(c), include two-way reinforced concrete slabs with\\ncapitals, drop panels, or both. These slabs are very satisfactory for heavy loads and long\\nspans. Although the formwork is more expensive than for ﬂat plates, ﬂat slabs will require less\\nconcrete and reinforcing than would be required for ﬂat plates with the same loads and spans.\\nThey are particularly economical for warehouses, parking and industrial buildings, and similar\\nstructures, where exposed drop panels or capitals are acceptable.\\nIn Figure 16.1(d), a two-way slab with beams is shown. This type of ﬂoor system is used\\nwhere its cost is less than the costs of ﬂat plates or ﬂat slabs. In other words, when the loads or\\nspans or both become quite large, the slab thickness and column sizes required for ﬂat plates or\\nﬂat slabs are of such magnitude that it is more economical to use two-way slabs with beams,\\ndespite the higher formwork costs.\\nAnother type of ﬂoor system is the wafﬂe slab . The ﬂoor is constructed by arranging\\nsquare ﬁberglass or metal pans with tapered sides with spaces. When the concrete is placed over\\nand between the pans and the forms are removed, the wafﬂe shape is obtained. The intervals\\n492'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 512}, page_content='McCormac c16.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 3:40 P.M.

With wafﬂe slabs, the weight of the concrete is greatly\\nreduced without signiﬁcantly changing the moment resistance of the ﬂoor system. As in ﬂat\\nplates, shear can be a problem near columns. Consequently, wafﬂe ﬂoors are usually made\\nsolid in those areas to increase shear resistance.\\n(a) One-way slab with beams\\n(b) Flat plate\\ndrop panel\\ncapital\\n(c) Flat slab\\nFIGURE 1 6 . 1 Slabs.\\n(continues)'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 513}, page_content='McCormac c16.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 3:40 P.M.

Page 495\\n16.3 Design of Two-Way Slabs by the ACI Code495\\n16.2 Analysis of Two-Way Slabs\\nTwo-way slabs bend under load into dish-shaped surf aces, so there is bending in both principal\\ndirections. As a result, they must be reinforced in both directions by layers of bars that are\\nperpendicular to each other. A theoretical elastic analysis for such slabs is a very complex\\nproblem because of their highly indeterminate nature. Numerical techniques such as ﬁnite\\ndifference and ﬁnite elements are required, but such methods require sophisticated software\\nto be practical in design. The methods described in this chapter can be done by hand or with\\nsimple spreadsheets, and are sufﬁciently accurate for most design problems.\\nActually, the fact that a great deal of stress redistribution can occur in such slabs at high\\nloads makes it unnecessary to make designs based on theoretical analyses. Therefore, the design\\nof two-way slabs is generally based on empirical moment coefﬁcients, which, although they\\nmight not accurately predict stress variations, result in slabs with satisfactory overall safety\\nfactors. In other words, if too much reinforcing is placed in one part of a slab and too little\\nsomewhere else, the resulting slab behavior will probably still be satisfactory. The total amount\\nof reinforcement in a slab seems more important than its exact placement.\\nYou should clearly understand that, although this chapter and the next are devoted to\\ntwo-way slab design based on approximate methods of analysis, there is no intent to prevent\\nthe designer from using more exact methods. Designers may design slabs on the basis of\\nnumerical solutions, yield-line analysis, or other theoretical methods, provided that it can be\\nclearly demonstrated that they have met all the necessary safety and service ability criteria\\nrequired by the ACI Code.\\nAlthough it has been the practice of designers for many years to use approximate analyses\\nfor design and to use average moments rather than maximum ones, two-way slabs so designed\\nhave proved to be very satisfactory under service loads. Furthermore, they have been proved\\nto have appreciable overload capacity.\\n16.3 Design of Two-Way Slabs by the ACI Code\\nThe ACI Code (13.5.1.1) speciﬁes two methods for designing two-way slabs for gravity loads.\\nThese are the direct design method and the equivalent frame method.\\nDirect Design Method\\nThe code (13.6) provides a procedure with which a set of moment coefﬁcients can be deter-\\nmined. The method, in effect, involves a single-cycle moment distribution analysis of the\\nstructure based on (a) the estimated ﬂexural stiffnesses of the slabs, beams (if any), and\\ncolumns and (b) the torsional stiffnesses of the slabs and beams (if any) transverse to the\\ndirection in which ﬂexural moments are being determined. Some types of moment coefﬁcients\\nhave been used satisfactorily for many years for slab design. They do not, however, give very\\nsatisfactory results for slabs with unsymmetrical dimensions and loading patterns.\\nEquivalent Frame Method\\nIn this method, a portion of a structure is taken out by itself, as shown in Figure 16.2, and\\nanalyzed much as a portion of a building frame was handled in Example 14.2. The same\\nstiffness values used for the direct design method are used for the equivalent frame method.\\nThis latter method, which is very satisfactory for symmetrical frames as well as for those with\\nunusual dimensions or loadings, is discussed in Chapter 17 of this text.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 515}, page_content='McCormac c16.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 3:40 P.M. Page 496\\n496 CHAPTER 1 6 Two-Way Slabs, Direct Design Method\\nFIGURE 1 6 . 2 Equivalent frame method.\\nDesign for Lateral Loads\\nThe ACI Code permits considerable freedom for the designer to model two-way slab systems\\nfor lateral loads. The method must satisfy equilibrium and geometric compatibility and be in\\nreasonable agreement with test data. The effects of cracking and such parameters as the slab\\naspect ratio and ratio of column-to-slab span dimensions should be considered 1 (ACI Section\\nR13.5.1.2).\\n16.4 Column and Middle Strips\\nAfter the design moments have been determined by either the direct design method or the\\nequivalent frame method, they are distributed acrosseach panel. The panels are divided into\\ncolumn and middle strips, as shown in Figure 16.3, and positive and negative moments are\\nestimated in each strip.

It includes beams\\nif they are present. The middle strip is the part of the slab between the two column strips.\\nThe part of the moments assigned to the column and middle strips may be assumed to be\\nuniformly spread over the strips. As will be described later in this chapter, the percentage of\\nthe moment assigned to a column strip depends on the effective stiffness of that strip and on its\\naspect ratio, l2/l1 (where l1 is the length of span, center to center, of supports in the direction\\nin which moments are being determined and l2 is the span length, center to center, of supports\\nin the direction transverse to l1). Note that Figure 16.3 shows column and middle strips in\\nonly one direction. A similar analysis must be performed in the perpendicular direction. The\\nresulting analysis will result in moments in both directions.\\n16.5 Shear Resistance of Slabs\\nFor two-way slabs supported by beams or walls, shears are calculated at a distance d from\\nthe faces of the walls or beams. The value of φVc is, as for beams, φ2λ\\n√\\nf ′cbw d. Shear is not\\nusually a problem for these types of slabs.\\nFor ﬂat slabs and ﬂat plates supported directly by columns, shear may be the critical\\nfactor in design. In almost all tests of such structures, failures have been the result of shear or\\nperhaps shear and torsion. These conditions are particularly serious around exterior columns.\\nTwo kinds of shear must be considered in the design of ﬂat slabs and ﬂat plates. These\\nare the same two that were considered in column footings—one-way and two-way shears (i.e.,\\nbeam shear and punching shear). For beam shear analysis, the slab is considered to act as a\\nwide beam running between the supports. The critical sections are taken at a distance d from'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 517}, page_content='McCormac c16.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 3:40 P.M.

For punching shear, the critical section is taken at a distance\\nd/2 from the face of the column, capital, or drop panel and the shear strength, as usually used\\nin footings, is φ4λ\\n√\\nf ′cbw d.\\nIf shear stresses are too large around interior columns, it is possible to increase the\\nshearing strength of the slabs by as much as 75% by using shearheads. A shearhead, as deﬁned\\nin Section 11.11.4 of the code, consists of four steel I or channel shapes fabricated into cross\\narms and placed in the slabs, as shown in Figure 16.4(a). The code states that shearhead designs\\nof this type do not apply at exterior columns. Thus, special designs are required, and the code\\ndoes not provide speciﬁc requirements. Shearheads increase the effectivebo for two-way shear,\\nand they also increase the negative moment resistance of the slab, as described in the code\\n(11.11.4.9). The negative moment reinforcing bars in the slab are usually run over the top of\\nthe steel shapes, while the positive reinforcing is normally stopped short of the shapes.\\nAnother type of shear reinforcement permitted in slabs by the code (11.11.3) involves\\nthe use of groups of bent bars or wires. One possible arrangement of such bars is shown in\\nFigure 16.4(b). The bars are bent across the potential diagonal tension cracks at 45◦ angles,\\nand they are run along the bottoms of the slabs for the distances needed to fully develop the\\n(a) Shearhead (b) Bent-bar arrangement\\n(c) Shear bar reinforcing\\nFIGURE 1 6 . 4 Shear reinforcement for slabs at columns.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 518}, page_content='McCormac c16.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 3:40 P.M.

Another type of bar arrangement that might be used is shown in Figure 16.4(c).\\nWhen bars (or wires) are used as shear reinforcement, the code (11.11.3.2) states that the\\nnominal two-way shear strength permitted on the critical section at a distance d/2 from the\\nface of the column may be increased from 4\\n√\\nf ′cbo d to 6\\n√\\nf ′cbod.\\nThe main advantage of shearheads is that they push the critical sections for shear far-\\nther out from the columns, thus giving a larger perimeter to resist the shear, as illustrated in\\nFigure 16.5. In this ﬁgure,lv is the length of the shearhead arm from the centroid of the con-\\ncentrated load or reaction, and c1 is the dimension of the rectangular or equivalent rectangular\\ncolumn or capital or bracket, measured in the direction in which moments are being calculated.\\nThe code (11.11.4.7) states that the critical section for shear shall cross the shearhead arm at a\\ndistance equal to 3\\n4 [lv − (c1/2)] from the column face, as shown in Figure 16.5(b). Alt hough\\nthis critical section is to be located so that its perimeter is a minimum, it does not have to be\\nlocated closer to the column face or edges of capitals or drop panels than d/2 at any point.\\nWhen shearhead reinforcing is provided with reinforcing bars or steel I or channel shapes,\\nthe maximum shear strength can be increased to 7\\n√\\nf ′cbo d at a distance d/2 from the column.\\nAccording to the code (11.11.4.8), this is permissible only if the maximum computed shear\\ndoes not exceed 4√\\nf ′cbo d along the dashed critical section for shear shown in Figure 16.5(b).\\ncolumnc1\\nc2\\nc1 + d\\nc1\\n`v\\n`v –       \\nd\\n2\\nd\\n2 3\\n4\\nc1\\n2\\n(a) No shearhead\\n(b) With shearhead\\ncolumn\\ncritical sections\\nfor shear\\nc2 + d\\nb0 = 2c1 + 2c2 + 4d\\n))\\nFIGURE 1 6 . 5 Critical sections for shear.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 519}, page_content='McCormac c16.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 3:40 P.M. Page 500\\n500 CHAPTER 1 6 Two-Way Slabs, Direct Design Method\\nIn Section 16.12, the subject of shear stresses is continued with a consideration of the\\ntransfer of moments and shears between slabs and columns. The maximum load that a two-way\\nslab can support is often controlled by this transfer strength.\\n16.6 Depth Limitations and Stiffness Requirements\\nIt is obviously very important to keep the various panels of a two-way slab relatively level (i.e.,\\nwith reasonably small deﬂections). Thin reinforced two-way slabs have quite a bit of moment\\nresistance, but deﬂections are often large. As a consequence, their depths are very carefully\\ncontrolled by the ACI Code so as to limit these deﬂections. This is accomplished by requiring\\nthe designer to either (a) compute deﬂections and make sure they are within certain limitations\\nor (b) use certain minimum thicknesses as speciﬁed in Section 9.5.3 of the code. Deﬂection\\ncomputations for two-way slabs are rather complicated, so the average designer usually uses\\nthe minimum ACI thickness values, presented in the next few paragraphs of this chapter.\\nSlabs without Interior Beams\\nFor a slab without interior beams spanning between its supports and with a ratio of its long\\nspan to short span not greater than 2.0, the minimum thickness can be taken from Table 16.1\\nof this chapter [Table 9.5(c) in the code]. The values selected from the table, however, must\\nnot be less than the following values (ACI 9.5.3.2):\\n1. Slabs without drop panels 5 in.\\n2.

It is the same as the total moment that occurs in a simply\\nsupported beam. For a uniform load per unit area, qu ,i ti sa sf o l l o w s :\\nMo = (qu l2)(l1)2\\n8\\nIn this expression, l1 is the span length, center to center, of supports in the direction in\\nwhich moments are being taken and l2 is the length of the span transverse to l1, measured\\ncenter to center of the supports.\\nThe moment that actually occurs in such a slab has been shown by experience and tests\\nto be somewhat less than the value determined by the above Mo expression. For this reason,\\nl1 is replaced with ln , the clear span measured face to face of the supports in the direction\\nin which moments are taken. The code (13.6.2.5) states that ln may not be taken to be less\\nthan 65% of the span l1 measured center to center of supports. If l1 is replaced with ln ,t h e\\nexpression for Mo , which is called the static moment, becomes\\nMo = (qu l2)(ln )2\\n8 (ACI Equation 13-4)\\nWhen the static moment is being calculated in the long direction, it is convenient to write it\\nas Mol , and in the short direction as Mos .\\nIt is next necessary to know what proportions of these total moments are positive and\\nwhat proportions are negative. If a slab was completely ﬁxed at the end of each panel, the\\ndivision would be as it is in a ﬁxed-end beam, two-thirds negative and one-third positive, as\\nshown in Figure 16.9.\\nThis division is reasonably accurate for interior panels where the slab is conti nuous for\\nseveral spans in each direction with equal span lengths and loads.

For cases where the span\\nlengths and loadings are different, the proportion of positive and negative moments may vary\\nappreciably, and the use of a more detailed method of analysis is desirable. The equivalent\\nframe method (Chapter 17) will provide rather good approximations for such situations.\\nThe relative stiffnesses of the columns and slabs of exterior panels are of far greater\\nsigniﬁcance in their effect on the moments than is the case for interior panels. The magnitudes of\\nthe moments are very sensitive to the amount of torsional restraint supplied at the discontinuous\\nedges. This restraint is provided both by the ﬂexural stiffness of the slab and by the ﬂexural\\nstiffness of the exterior column.\\nShould the stiffness of an exterior column be quite small, the end negative moment will\\nbe very close to zero. If the stiffness of the exterior column is very large, the positive and\\nnegative moments will still not be the same as those in an interior panel unless an edge beam\\nwith a very large torsional stiffness is provided that will substantially prevent rotation of the\\ndiscontinuous edge of the slab.\\nIf a 2-ft-wide beam were to be framed into a 2-ft-wide column of inﬁnite ﬂexural stiffness\\nin the plane of the beam, the joint would behave as would a perfectly ﬁxed end, and the negative\\nbeam moment would equal the ﬁxed-end moment.\\nIf a two-way slab 24 ft wide were to be framed into this same 2-ft-wide column of inﬁnite\\nstiffness, the situation of no rotation would occur along the part of the slab at the column. For\\nthe remaining 11 ft widths of slab on each side of the column, there would be rotation varying\\nfrom zero at the side face of the column to maximums 11 ft on each side of the column. As a\\nresult of this rotation, the negative moment at the face of the column would be less than the\\nﬁxed-end moment. Thus, the stiffness of the exterior column is reduced by the rotation of the\\nattached transverse slab.\\nTo take into account the fact that the rotation of the edge of the slab is different at\\ndifferent distances from the column, the exterior columns and slab edge beam are replaced\\nwith an equivalent column that has the same estimated ﬂexibility as the column plus the edge\\nbeam. It can be seen that this is quite an involved process; therefore, instead of requiring a\\ncomplicated analysis, the code (13.6.3.3) provides a set of percentages for dividing the total\\nfactored static moment into its positive and negative parts in an end span. These divisions,\\nwhich are shown in Table 16.2, include values for unrestrained edges (where the slab is\\nsimply supported on a masonry or concrete wall) and for restrained edges (where the slab is\\nconstructed integrally with a very stiff reinforced concrete wall so that the little rotation occurs\\nat the slab-to-wall connection).\\nIn Figure 16.10, the distribution of the total factored moment for the interior and exterior\\nspans of a ﬂat-plate structure is shown. The plate is assumed to be constructed without beams\\nbetween interior supports and without edge beams.\\nTABLE 16. 2 Distribution of Total Span Moment in an End Span (ACI Code 13.6.3.3)\\n(1)\\n (2)\\n (3)\\n (4)\\n (5)\\nSlab Without Beams\\nbetween Interior Supports\\nExterior Edge\\n Slab with Beams\\n Without\\n With Edge\\n Exterior Edge\\nUnrestrained\\n between All Supports\\n Edge Beam\\n Beam\\n Fully Restrained\\nInterior negative\\nfactored moment\\n 0.75\\n 0.70\\n 0.70\\n 0.70\\n 0.65\\nPositive factored\\nmoment\\n 0.63\\n 0.57\\n 0.52\\n 0.50\\n 0.35\\nExterior negative\\nfactored moment\\n 0\\n 0.16\\n 0.26\\n 0.30\\n 0.65\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 527}, page_content='McCormac c16.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 3:40 P.M.

The procedure\\nspeciﬁed in Chapter 13 of the ACI Code is applicable not only to ﬂat plates but also to ﬂat\\nslabs, wafﬂe slabs, and two-way slabs with beams. The steps necessary to perform the designs\\nare brieﬂy summarized at the end of this paragraph. The order of the steps may have to be\\nvaried somewhat for different types of slab designs. Either the direct design method or the\\nequivalent frame method may be used to determine the design moments. The design steps are\\nas follows:\\n1. Estimate the slab thickness to meet the code requirements.\\n2. Determine the depth required for shear.\\n3. Calculate the total static moments to be resisted in the two directions.\\n4. Estimate the percentages of the static moments that are positive and negative, and pro-\\nportion the resulting values between the column and middle strips.\\n5. Select the reinforcing.\\nExample 16.3 illustrates this method of design applied to a ﬂat plate.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 531}, page_content='McCormac c16.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 3:40 P.M.

If this example were an end span, then the total static\\nmoment would be divided into positive and negative values in accordance with Table 16.2.\\nThe next step is to divide the moments determined in the previous paragraph into column\\nand middle strips. Again, since this is an interior span, Table 16.3 applies. Sinceαf1 = 0( n o\\ninterior beams), 75% of the moment goes to the column strip. This value is independent ofl2/l1\\nfor the case where there are no interior beams. The remaining 25% of the moment is assigned\\nto the middle strip, half on each side of the column strip. Table 16.5 is used to determine how\\nmuch of the total positive moment is assigned to the column strip. In this case, sinceαf1 = 0,\\n60% goes to the column strip, and the remaining 40% is assigned to the middle strip, half on\\neach side of the column strip.\\nThese calculations can be conveniently arranged, as in Table 16.6. This table is very\\nsimilar to the one used for the design of the continuous one-way slab in Chapter 14.\\nTo assist in the interpretation of Table 16.6, the numbers in the ﬁrst column will be dis-\\ncussed. The ﬁrst is the determination of Mu. This calculation uses the 0.65 factor from ACI\\n13.6.3.2 and the 0.75 factor from Table 16.3, both applied to the total static moment of\\n181.2 ft-k.

The remaining entries in\\nTable 16.6 follow a similar procedure.\\nAs the different percentages of moments are selected from the tables for the column and\\nmiddle strips of this slab, it will be noted thatαf = 0.\\nIn the solution to Example 16.3, it will be noted that the Mu /φbd2 values are sometimes\\nquite small, and thus most of the ρ values do not fall within Table A.12 (see Appendix A).\\nFor such cases, the authors use the temperature and shrinkage minimum 0.0018 bh.\\nActually, the temperature reinforcing includes bars in the top and bottom of the slab.\\nIn the negative moment region, some of the positive steel bars have been extended into the\\nsupport region and are also available for temperature and shrinkage steel. If desirable, these\\npositive bars can be lapped instead of being stopped in the support.\\nThe selection of the reinforcing bars is the ﬁnal step taken in the design of this ﬂat\\nplate. The code Figure 13.3.8 (given as Figure 16.15 here) shows the minimum lengths of slab\\nreinforcing bars for ﬂat plates and for ﬂat slabs with drop panels. This ﬁgure shows that some\\nof the positive reinforcing must be run into the support area.\\nThe bars selected for this ﬂat plate are shown in Figure 16.16. Bent bars are used in this\\nexample, but straight bars could have been used just as well. There seems to be a trend among\\ndesigners in the direction of using more straight bars in slabs and fewer bent bars.\\n16.10 Placing of Live Loads\\nThe moments in a continuous ﬂoor slab are appreciably affected by different positions or\\npatterns of the live loads. The usual procedure, however, is to calculate the total static moments,\\nassuming that all panels are subjected to full live load. When different loading patterns are\\nused, the moments can be changed so much that overstressing may occur in the slab.\\nSection 13.7.6.2 of the code states that if a variable unfactored live load does not exceed\\nthree-fourths of the unfactored dead load, or if it is of a type such that all panels will be loaded\\nsimultaneously, it is permissible to assume that full live load placed over the entire area will\\ncause maximum moment values throughout the entire slab system.\\nFor other loading conditions, it may be assumed (according to ACI Section 13.7.6.3) that\\nmaximum positive moment at the midspan of a panel will occur when three-fourths of the full\\nfactored live load is placed on the panel in question and on alternate spans.

Not only is the load transferred\\nby shear from the slab to the column along an area around the column, but also there may\\nbe moments that have to be transferred. The moment situation is usually most critical at the\\nexterior columns.\\nIf there are moments to be transferred, they will cause shear stresses of their own in the\\nslabs, as will be described in this section. Furthermore, shear forces resulting from moment\\ntransfer must be considered in the design of the lateral column reinforcement (i.e., ties and\\nspirals), as stated in Section 11.10.1 of the code.\\nWhen columns are supporting slabs without beams (i.e., ﬂat plates or ﬂat slabs), the\\nload transfer situation between the slabs and columns is extremely critical.

The transfer is made by both ﬂexure and eccentric shear, the latter being located at a\\ndistance of about d/2 from the column face.\\nSection 13.6.3.6 of the code states that for moment transfer between the slab and edge\\ncolumn, the gravity load moment to be transferred shall be 0.3 Mo (where Mo is the factored\\nstatical moment).\\nWhen gravity loads, wind or earthquake loads, or other lateral forces cause a transfer\\nof an unbalanced moment between a slab and a column, a part of the moment equal to γf Mu\\nshall be transferred by ﬂexure, according to ACI Section 13.5.3.2. Based on both tests and\\nexperience, this transfer is to be considered to be made within an effective slab width between\\nlines that are located one and a half times the slab or drop panel thickness outside opposite\\nfaces of the column or capital.

Should nonprismatic members\\nbe encountered, such as the continuous beam of Figure 17.1, none of the pr eceding values\\napplies.\\nCarryover factors, ﬁxed-end moments, and so forth can be laboriously obtained by various\\nmethods, such as the moment-area and column-analogy methods. 1 There are various tables\\navailable, however, from which many of these values can be obtained. The tables numbered\\nA.16 through A.20 of Appendix A cover most situations encountered with the equivalent frame\\nmethod.\\nBefore the equivalent frame method is discussed, an assumed set of ﬁxed-end moments\\nis balanced in Example 17.1 for the nonprismatic beam of Figure 17.1. The authors’ purpose\\nin presenting this example is to show the reader how moment distribution can be applied to\\nthe analysis of structures consisting of nonprismatic members.\\nExample 17.1\\nThe carryover factors (C.O.), stiffness factors ( K), and ﬁxed-end moments (FEM) shown in\\nFigure 17.2 have been assumed for the continuous nonprismatic member of Figure 17.1.\\nBalance these moments by moment distribution. It will be shown later, in Example 17.2, how to\\ndetermine these factors for two-way slab systems. The purpose of this example is to demonstrate\\nthe moment distribution method when nonprismatic members are involved.\\nFIGURE 1 7 . 1 Nonprismatic beam.\\n1 McCormac, J.

A part of a\\ntwo-way slab building will be taken out by itself and analyzed by moment distribution. The\\nslab-beam members of this part of the structure will be nonprismatic because of the columns,\\nbeams, drop panels, and so on of which they consist. As a result, it will be quite similar to the\\nbeam of Figure 17.1, and we will analyze it in the same manner.\\nThe only difference between the direct design method and the equivalent frame method\\nis in the determination of the longitudinal moments in the spans of the equivalent rigid frame.\\nWhereas the direct design method involves a one-cycle moment distribution, the equivalent\\nframe method involves a normal moment distribution of several cycles. The design moments\\nobtained by either method are distributed to the column and middle strips in the same fashion.\\nIt will be remembered that the range in which the direct design method can be applied is\\nlimited by a maximum 2-to-1 ratio of live-to-dead load and a maximum ratio of the longitudinal\\nspan length to the transverse span length of 2 to 1. In addition, the columns may not be'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 553}, page_content='McCormac c17.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 3:54 P.M.

There are no such limitations on the equivalent\\nframe method. This is a very important matter because so many ﬂoor systems do not meet the\\nlimitations speciﬁed for the direct design method.\\nAnalysis by either method will yield almost the same moments for those slabs that meet\\nthe limitations required for application of the direct design method. For such cases, it is simpler\\nto use the direct design method.\\nThe equivalent frame method involves the elastic analysis of a structural frame consisting\\nof a row of equivalent columns and horizontal slab members that are each one panel long and\\nhave a transverse width equal to the distance between centerlines of the panels on each side\\nof the columns in question. For instance, the hatched strip of the ﬂoor system in Figure 17.3\\ncan be extracted and the combined slab and beam analyzed to act as a beam element as part\\nof a structural frame (see also Figure 17.4). This assumption approximately models the actual\\nbehavior of the structure. It is a reasonably accurate way of calculating moments in the overall\\nstructural frame, which then may be distributed to the slab and beams. This process is carried\\nout in both directions. That is, it is done to the hatched strip in Figure 17.3 and all other strips\\nparallel to it. Then it is carried out on strips that are perpendicular to these strips, hence the\\nterm two-way ﬂoor system.\\nFIGURE 1 7 . 4 Equivalent frame for the crosshatched strip of\\nFigure 17.3 for vertical loading.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 554}, page_content='McCormac c17.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 3:54 P.M. Page 535\\n17.3 Properties of Slab Beams 535\\nFor vertical loads, each ﬂoor, together with the columns a bove and below, is analyzed\\nseparately. For such an analysis, the far ends of the columns are considered ﬁxed. Figure 17.4\\nshows a typical equivalent slab beam as described in this chapter.\\nShould there be a large number of panels, the moment at a particular joint in a slab\\nbeam can be satisfactorily obtained by assuming that the member is ﬁxed two panels away.\\nThis simpliﬁcation is permissible because vertical loads in one panel only appreciably affect\\nthe forces in that panel and in the one adjacent to it on each side.\\nFor lateral loads, it is necessary to consider an equivalent frame that extends for the entire\\nheight of the building, because the forces in a particular member are affected by the lateral\\nforces on all the stories above the ﬂoor being considered. When lateral loads are considered,\\nit will be necessary to analyze the frame for them and combine the results with analyses made\\nfor gravity loads (ACI Code 13.5.1.3).\\nThe equivalent frame is made up of the horizontal slab, any beams spanning in the\\ndirection of the frame being considered, the columns or other members that provide vertical\\nsupport above and below the slab, and any parts of the structure that provide moment transfer\\nbetween the horizontal and vertical members. You can see there will be quite a difference in\\nmoment transfer from the case where a column provides this transfer and where there is a\\nmonolithic reinforced concrete wall extending over the full length of the frame. For cases in\\nbetween, the stiffnesses of the torsional members such as edge beams will be estimated.\\nThe same minimum ACI slab thicknesses must be met as in the direct design method.\\nThe depths should be checked for shear at columns and other supports, as speciﬁed in Section\\n11.12 of the code. Once the moments have been computed, it will also be necessary to check\\nfor moment shear transfer at the supports.\\nThe analysis of the frame is made for the full design live load applied to all spans, unless\\nthe actual unfactored live load exceeds 0.75 times the unfactored dead load (ACI Code 13.7.6).\\nWhen the live load is greater than 0.75 times the dead load, a pattern loading with three-fourths\\ntimes the live load is used for calculating moments and shears.\\nThe maximum positive moment in the middle of a span is assumed to occur when three-\\nfourths of the full design load is applied in that panel and in alternate spans. The maximum\\nnegative moment in the slab at a support is assumed to occur when three-fourths of the full\\ndesign live load is applied only to the adjacent panels. The values so obtained may not be less\\nthan those calculated, assuming full live loads in all spans.\\n17.3 Properties of Slab Beams\\nThe parts of the frame are the slabs, beams, drop panels, columns, and so on. Our ﬁrst objective\\nis to compute the properties of the slab beams and the columns (i.e., the stiffness factors,\\ndistribution factors, carryover factors, and ﬁxed-end moments). To simplify this work, the\\nproperties of the members of the frame are permitted by the ACI Code (13.7.3.1) to be based\\non their gross moments of inertia rather than their transformed or cracked sections. Despite the\\nuse of the gross dimensions of members, the calculations involved in determining the properties\\nof nonprismatic members still represent a lengthy task, and we will ﬁnd the use of available\\ntables very helpful.\\nFigures 17.5 and 17.6 present sketches of two-way slab structures, together with the\\nequivalent frames that will be used for their analysis. A ﬂat slab with columns is shown in\\nFigure 17.5(a). Cross sections of the structure are shown through the slab in part (b) of the\\nﬁgure and through the column in part (c). In part (d), the equivalent frame that will be used\\nfor the actual numerical calculations is shown. In this ﬁgure, Ecs is the modulus of elasticity\\nof the concrete slab. With section 2-2, a ﬁctitious section is shown that will have a stiffness\\napproximately equivalent to that of the actual slab and column. An expression forI for the\\nequivalent section is also given.

For stiffness calculations, the moments of inertia of\\ncolumns are based on their gross dimensions. Thus, if capitals are present, the effect of their\\ndimensions must be used for those parts of the columns. Columns are assumed to be inﬁnitely\\nstiff for the depth of the slabs.\\nFigure 17.7 shows a sample column, together with its column stiffness diagram. Sim-\\nilar diagrams are shown for other columns (where there are drop panels, capitals, etc.) in\\nFigure 13.7.4 of the 1983 ACI Commentary.\\nWith a column stiffness diagram, the column ﬂexural stiffness, Kc, can be determined\\nby the conjugate beam procedure or other methods. Tabulated values of Kc are given in Table\\nA.20 of the Appendix A of this text for typical column situations.\\nIn applying moment distribution to a particular frame, we need the stiffnesses of the slab\\nbeam, the torsional members, and the equivalent column so that the distribution factors can be\\ncalculated. For this purpose, the equivalent column, the equivalent slab beam, and the torsional\\nmembers are needed at a particular joint.\\nFor this discussion, see Figure 17.8, where it is assumed that there is a column above\\nand below the joint in question. Thus, the column stiffness (Kc ) here is assumed to include\\nthe stiffness of the column above (Kct ) and the one below (Kcb ). Thus, /Sigma1Kc = Kct + Kcb.I na\\nsimilar fashion, the total torsional stiffness is assumed to equal that of the torsional members\\non both sides of the joint(/Sigma1Kt = Kt1 + Kt2). For an exterior frame, the torsional member will\\nbe located on one side only.\\nThe following approximate expression for the stiffness (Kt ) of the torsional member was\\ndetermined using a three-dimensional analysis for various slab conﬁgurations (ACI R13.7.5).\\nKt = /Sigma19Ecs C\\nl2\\n(\\n1 − c2\\nl2\\n⎡3\\nh h\\n2\\nh EI = ∞\\nEI = ∞\\nEccIc\\n2\\n(a) Actual column and\\nslab, no beams\\n(b) Column stiffness\\n dia gram\\nh\\n`c\\nFIGURE 1 7 . 7 Equivalent column.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 558}, page_content='McCormac c17.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 3:54 P.M.

Since the late 1800s, however, the non–load-bearing wall has become quite\\ncommon because other members of the structural frame can be used to provide stab ility. As a\\nresult, today we have walls that serve all sorts of purposes, such as retaining walls, basement\\nwalls, partition walls, ﬁre walls, and so on. These walls may or may not be of a load-bearing\\ntype.\\nIn this chapter, the following kinds of concrete walls will be considered: non–load-\\nbearing, load-bearing, and shear walls (the latter being either load-bearing or non–load-bearing).\\n18.2 Non–Load-Bearing Walls\\nNon–load-bearing walls are those that support only their own weight and perhaps some lateral\\nloads. Falling into this class are retaining walls, fac ¸ade-type walls, and some basement walls.\\nFor Non–load-bearing walls, the ACI Code provides several speciﬁc limitations, which are\\nlisted at the end of this paragraph. The values given for minimum reinforcing quantities and\\nwall thicknesses do not have to be met if lesser values can be proved satisfactory by structural\\nanalysis (14.2.7). The numbers given in parentheses are ACI section numbers.\\n1. The thickness of a Non–load-bearing wall cannot be less than 4 in. or 1\\n30 times the least\\ndistance between members that provide lateral support (14.6.1).\\n2. The minimum amount of vertical reinforcement as a percentage of gross concrete area\\nis 0.0012 for deformed bars #5 or smaller with fy = at least 60,000 psi, 0.0015 for other\\ndeformed bars, and 0.0012 for plain or deformed welded wire fabric not larger than\\nW31 or D31—that is, 5\\n8 in. in diameter (14.3.2).\\n3. The vertical reinforcement does not have to be enclosed by ties unless the percentage\\nof vertical reinforcing is greater than 0.01 times the gross concrete area or where the\\nvertical reinforcing is not required as compression reinforcing (14.3.6).\\n4. The minimum amount of horizontal reinforcing as a percentage of gross concrete area is\\n0.0020 for deformed bars #5 or smaller with fy ≥ 60,000 psi, 0.0025 for other deformed\\nbars, and 0.0020 for plain or deformed welded wire fabric not larger than W31 or D31\\n(14.3.3).\\n5. The spacing of vertical and horizontal reinforcement may not exceed three times the\\nwall thickness, or 18 in. (14.3.5).\\n6. Reinforcing for walls more than 10 in. thick (not including basement walls) must be\\nplaced in two layers as follows: one layer containing from one-half to two-thirds of the\\ntotal reinforcing placed in the exterior surface not less than 2 in. nor more than one-third\\n547'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 567}, page_content='McCormac c18.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 4:00 P.M.

For walls less than 10 in. thick, the code does not specify two layers of steel, but to\\ncontrol shrinkage, it is probably a good practice to put one layer on the face of walls\\nexposed to view and one on the nonstressed side of foundation walls 10 ft or more in\\nheight.\\n8. In addition to the reinforcing speciﬁed in the pr eceding paragraphs, at least two #5 bars\\nin walls having two layers of reinforcement in both directions, and one #5 bar in walls\\nhaving a single layer of reinforcement in both directions, must be provided around all\\nwindow, door, and similar-sized openings. These bars must be anchored to develop fy\\nin tension at the corners of the openings (14.3.7).\\n9. For cast-in-place walls, the area of reinforcing across the interface between a wall and\\na footing must be no less than the minimum vertical wall reinforcing given in 14.3.2\\n(15.8.2.2).\\n10. For precast, nonprestressed walls, the reinforcement must be designed in accordance\\nwith the preceding requirements on this list, as well as the requirements of Chapter 10\\nor 14 of the code, except that the area of the horizontal and vertical reinforcing must\\nnot be less than 0.001 times the gross cross-sectional area of the wall. In addition, the\\nspacing of the reinforcing may not be greater than ﬁve times the wall thickness or 30 in.\\nfor interior walls, or 18 in. for exterior ones (16.4.2).'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 568}, page_content='McCormac c18.tex V2 - January 10, 2013 10:20 P.M.

As a result of their considerable in-plane stiffnesses, they\\nare quite important in resisting wind and earthquake forces.\\nLoad-bearing walls with solid rectangular cross sections may be designed as were\\ncolumns subject to axial load and bending, or they may be designed by an empirical method\\ngiven in Section 14.5 of the code. The empirical method may be used only if the resultant of\\nall the factored loads falls within the middle third of the wall (i.e., the eccentricity must be\\nequal to or less than one-sixth the thickness of the wall).Whichever of the two met hods is\\nused, the design must meet the minimum requirements given in the preceding section of this\\nchapter for non–load-bearing walls .\\nThis section is devoted to the empirical design method, which is applicable to rela-\\ntively short vertical walls with approximately concentric loads. The code (14.5.2) provides\\nan empirical formula for calculating the design axial load strength of solid rectangular cross-\\nsectional walls withe less than one-sixth of wall thicknesses. Should walls have nonrectangular\\ncross sections (such as ribbed wall panels) and/or should e be greater than one-sixth of wall\\nthicknesses, the rational design procedure for columns subject to axial load and bending\\n(Section 14.4) must be followed.\\nThe practical use of the empirical wall formula, which is given at the end of this para-\\ngraph, is for relatively short walls with small moments. When lateral loads are involved,\\newill quickly exceed one-sixth of wall thicknesses. The number 0.55 in the equation is an\\neccentricity factor that causes the equation to yield a strength approximately equal to that which\\nCourtesy of EFCO Corp.\\nThirty-two-foot-tall foundation walls for the MCI Mid-Continent Data Center in\\nOmaha, Nebraska.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 569}, page_content='McCormac c18.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 4:00 P.M.

The horizontal length of a wall that can be considered effective for each concentrated\\nload may not exceed the smaller of the center-to-center distance between loads or the\\nbearing width plus four times the wall thickness. This provision may be waived if a\\nlarger value can be proved satisfactory by a detailed analysis (14.2.4).\\n4. Load-bearing walls must be anchored to intersecting elements, such as ﬂoors or roofs,\\nor they should be anchored to columns, pilasters, footings, buttresses, and intersecting\\nwalls (14.2.6).\\nThe empirical method is quite easy to apply because only one calculation has to be made\\nto determine the design axial strength of a wall.

The minimum vertical and horizontal reinforcing requirements\\nof Section 14.3 of the code must be met.\\nThe design of walls as columns is difﬁcult unless design aids are available. V arious wall\\ndesign aids are available from the Portland Cement Association, but the designer can prepare\\nhis or her own aids, such as axial load and bending interaction diagrams. The designs may be\\ncomplicated by the fact that walls often will be classiﬁed as “long columns” with the result that\\nthe slenderness requirements of Section 10.10 of the code will have to be met. An alternative\\nprocedure for slender walls is presented in ACI Section 14.8.\\nV ery slender walls are rather common, particularly in tilt-up wall construction. The\\nPortland Cement Association has available a design aid that is particularly useful for such\\ncases.2\\nThe interaction diagrams discussed in Section 10.6 of this text can be used to design\\nwalls with steel in two layers and subject to out-of-plane bending combined with axial loads.\\nHowever, the reinforcement ratio is limited to 0.01, unless the compression reinforcement is\\nlaterally tied (ACI Section 14.3.6), which is impractical in many cases. Graphs 2 through 5 in\\nAppendix A are applicable to walls that have two layers of steel. The values of γ for these\\ngraphs may be too large, however, especially for thinner walls. Example 18.2 illustrates how\\nto use these design aids when designing walls.\\nExample 18.2\\nDesign the reinforced concrete foundation wall shown in Figure 18.2 that has the following\\nconditions: l = 15 ft between lateral supports, backﬁll height is also 15 ft, PD = 520 plf at\\ne = 2i n . ,and PL = 250 plf ate = 2 in. Assume the base is pinned.\\nf′\\nc = 4000 psi, normal-weight aggregate concrete, Grade 60 reinforcing steel\\nSoil properties,ka = 0.40, γ = 100 pcf\\nSOLUTION\\nAssuming that the wall is simply supported at both the top and bottom, the soil pressure exerted\\non the wall increases linearly from zero at the top of backﬁll tokaγ l at the base. The maximum\\nbending moment3 is\\nMH = 0.064kaγ l3 = (0.064) (0.4) (100 pcf) (15 ft)3\\n= 8640 ft-lb/ft = 103,680 in-lb/ft\\nMaximum moment occurs at 0.577l = 8.66 ft from top of wall or 6.34 ft from the bottom.\\nNote that the eccentric axial loads cause a reduction in the moment. In the case of dead axial\\nload, the moment at the top of the wall is P × e = 520 plf(2 in.)= 1040 in-lb/ft. This moment\\nvaries linearly to zero at the base of the wall, so at the location of maximum soil moment, its\\nvalue is 1040 in-lb(6.34 ft)/15 ft= 440 in-lb/ft. The same analysis applied to the live load results\\nin a moment of 212 in-lb/ft. In this case, the reduction in moment from eccentric axial load is\\n2 Portland Cement Association, 2005.

Also, a value ofφ = 0.9 was used because\\nwhen reading the graph, it is obvious that the controlling points are below the line forϵt = 0.005.\\nUsing the resulting value of ρt, Ast = ρt bh = 0.010(12 in.)

Horizontal reinforcing must be provided in accordance with ACI 14.3.3(b),As ≥ 0.0025bh =\\n0.0025(12 in.) (8 in.)= 0.24 in2/ft. Choose #4 at 18 in. o.c. horizontally in both faces. Since this\\nwall is less than 10 in. thick, ACI 14.3.4 permits the reinforcement to be placed in a single\\nlayer. However, Graph 2 is based on having steel in two layers separated by a distance of\\nγ h = 0.6(8) = 4.8 in. Actually, a value ofγ = 0.5 would have been a better choice in this problem\\nin order to provide sufﬁcient cover, but it is not available.\\nBecause the axial load is so small in this case, the wall could have been designed as a\\nvertical beam with compression steel. The beam width would be 12 in.,h = 8i n . ,d = 6.4 in., and\\nthe moment taken as 167 in-k. The authors carried out this design approach using the Chapter\\n5 spreadsheet and calculated a required area of reinforcing steel of 0.98 in2/ft (compared with\\n0.96 in2/ft from Graph 2).\\nThe wall exerts reactions at the bottom against the footing and at the top against the ﬂoor.\\nThe ﬂoor system must be designed to resist this horizontal force, which is called a ‘‘diaphragm\\nforce.’’ At the bottom, the interface of the wall and the footing must be designed for shear\\ntransfer between these elements. Shear friction (Section 8.12 of this text) is the best way to\\naccommodate this transfer.\\nNote that this wall has a slenderness ratio ofklu/r = 1.0(15 ft)12 in/ft/(0.3) (8 in.)= 75 >\\n34 − 12(0/M2) = 34, so slenderness must be considered. However, since the axial loads are so\\nsmall, the moment magniﬁer is not greater than 1.0; hence the moment is not magniﬁed.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 573}, page_content='McCormac c18.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 4:00 P.M. Page 554\\n554 CHAPTER 1 8 Walls\\nIf this wall were not laterally supported at the top by the ﬂoor shown in Figure 18.2, it\\nwould be a retaining wall. The bending moment from soil pressure on the retaining wall would\\nbe MH = kaγ l3/6, which is 260% of the moment in Example 18.2. Be sure to use the correct\\nmoment for the boundary conditions that apply to your type of construction.\\nIf the reinforcement ratio had exceeded 0.01, this method of solution would not have been\\nvalid. It would have been necessary to use mechanics to determine the wall capacity without\\nusing steel in compression. The design aids used in this example use the compression force in\\nthe reinforcing steel, hence the steel has to be laterally tied for this solution to be valid.\\n18.5 Shear Walls\\nFor tall buildings, it is necessary to provide adequate stiffness to resist the lateral forces caused\\nby wind and earthquake. When such buildings are not properly designed for these forces, there\\nmay be very high stresses, vibrations, and sidesway when the forces occur. The results may\\ninclude not only severe damages to the buildings but also considerable discomfort for their\\noccupants.\\nWhen reinforced concrete walls with their very large in-plane stiffnesses are placed at\\ncertain convenient and strategic locations, often they can be economically used to provide the\\nneeded resistance to horizontal loads. Such walls, called shear walls, are in effect deep vertical\\ncantilever beams that provide lateral stability to structures by resisting the in-plane shears and\\nbending moments caused by the lateral forces.\\nAs the strength of shear walls is almost always controlled by their ﬂexural resistance,\\ntheir name is something of a misnomer. It is true, however, that on some occasions they may\\nrequire some shear reinforcing to prevent diagonal tension failures. Indeed, one of the basic\\nrequirements of shear walls designed for high seismic forces is to ensure ﬂexure rather than\\nshear-controlled design.\\nClemson University, 2008.\\nShear wall with integral end columns—Rhodes Annex.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 574}, page_content='McCormac c18.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 4:00 P.M.

The stiffnesses\\nof the ﬂoor slabs horizontally are quite large as compared to the stiffnesses of the walls and\\ncolumns. Thus, it is assumed that each ﬂoor is displaced in its horizontal plane as a rigidbody.\\nFigure 18.3 shows the plan of a building that is subjected to horizontal forces. The lateral\\nforces, usually from wind or earthquake loads, are applied to the ﬂoor and roof slabs of the\\nbuilding, and those slabs, acting as large beams lying on their sides or diaphragms, transfer\\nthe loads primarily to the shear walls A and B. Should the lateral forces be coming from the\\nother (perpendicular) direction, they would be resisted primarily by the shear walls C and D.\\nThe walls must be sufﬁciently stiff so as to limit deﬂections to reasonable values.\\nShear walls are commonly used for buildings with ﬂat-plate ﬂoor slabs. In fact, this\\ncombination of slabs and walls is the most common type of construction used today for tall\\napartment buildings and other residential buildings.\\nCourtesy of Professor Larry Kahn, Georgia Institute of Technology.\\nButtress shear wall, New York H ilton, New York, New York.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 575}, page_content='McCormac c18.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 4:00 P.M.

If the walls are carefully\\nand symmetrically placed in plan, they will efﬁciently resist both vertical and lateral loads and\\ndo so without interfering substantially with the architectural requirements. Reinforced concrete\\nbuildings of up to 70 stories have been constructed with shear walls as their primary source\\nof lateral stiffness. In the horizontal direction, full shear walls may be used—that is, they will\\nrun for the full panel or bay lengths. When forces are smaller, they need only run for partial\\nbay lengths.\\nShear walls may be used to resist lateral forces only, or they may be used in addition\\nas bearing walls. Furthermore, they may be used to enclose elevators, stairwells, and perhaps\\nrestrooms, as shown in Figure 18.4. These box-type structures are very satisfactory for resisting\\nhorizontal forces.\\nAnother possible arrangement of shear walls is shown in Figure 18.5. Although shear\\nwalls may be also be needed in the long direction of this building, they are not included in\\nthis ﬁgure.\\nOn most occasions, it is not possible to use shear walls wit hout some openings in them\\nfor doors, windows, and penetrations for mechanical services. Usually it is possible, however,\\nwith careful planning to place these openings so they do not seriously affect stiffnesses or\\nstresses in the walls. When the openings are small, their overall effect is minor, but this is not\\nthe case when large openings are present.\\nUsually the openings (windows, doors, etc.) are placed in vertical and symmetrical rows in\\nthe walls throughout the height of the structure.

Although\\nshear wall designs are often handled with empirical equations, they can be appreciably affected\\nby the designer’s previous experience.\\nWhen earthquake-resistant construction is being considered, note that the relatively stiff\\nparts of a structure will attract much larger forces than will the more ﬂexible parts. A structure\\nwith reinforced concrete shear walls is going to be quite stiff and, thus, will attract large seismic\\nforces. If the shear walls are brittle and fail, the rest of the structure may not be able to take\\nthe shock. If the shear walls are ductile, however (and they will be if properly reinforced),\\nthey will be very effective in resisting seismic forces.\\nTall reinforced concrete buildings are often designed with shear walls to resist seismic\\nforces, and such buildings have performed quite well in recent eart hquakes. During an earth-\\nquake, properly designed shear walls will decidedly limit the amount of damage to the structural\\nframe. They will also minimize damages to the nonstructural parts of a building, such as the\\nwindows, doors, ceilings, and partitions.\\nFigure 18.6 shows a shear wall subjected to a lateral force, Vu . The wall is in actuality\\na cantilever beam of width h and overall depth lw . In part (a) of the ﬁgure, the wall is being\\nbent from left to right by Vu , with the result that tensile bars are needed on the left or tensile\\nside. If Vu is applied from the right side as shown in part (b) of the ﬁgure, tensile bars will\\nbe needed on the right-hand end of the wall. Thus, it can be seen that a shear wall needs\\ntensile reinforcing on both sides becauseVu can come from either direction. For horizontal\\nshear calculations, the depth of the beam from the compression end of the wall to the center\\nof gravity of the tensile bars is estimated to be about 0.8 times the wall length,lw ,a sp e rA C I\\nSection 11.10.4. (If a larger value of d is obtained by a proper strain compatibility analysis, it\\nmay be used.)\\nThe shear wall acts as a vertical cantilever beam. In providing lateral support, it is\\nsubjected to both bending and shear forces. For such a wall, the maximum shear, Vu ,a n dt h e\\nmaximum moment, Mu , can be calculated at the base. If ﬂexural stresses are calculated, their\\nmagnitude will be affected by the design axial load, Nu , and thus its effect should be included\\nin the analysis.\\nShear is more important in walls with small height-to-length ratios. Moments will be\\nmore important for higher walls, particularly those with uniformly distributed reinforcing.\\nIt is necessary to provide both horizontal and vertical shear reinforcing for shear walls.\\nThe commentary (R11.9.9) says that in low walls, the horizontal shear reinforcing is less effec-\\ntive, and the vertical shear reinforcing is more effective. For high walls, the situation is reversed.\\nThis situation is reﬂected in ACI Equation 11-32, which is presented in the next section.

All of the walls in a building should have the same thickness if practical. Such\\na practice will permit the reuse of forms, ties, and other items. Furthermore, it will reduce the\\npossibilities of ﬁeld mistakes.\\nAs few openings as possible should be pl aced in concrete walls. Where openings are\\nnecessary, it is desirable to repeat the sizes and positions of openings in different walls rather\\nthan using different sizes and positions. Furthermore, a few large openings are more economical\\nthan a larger number of smaller ones.\\nMuch money can be saved if a footing elevation can be kept constant for any given\\nwall. Such a practice will appreciably simplify the use of wall forms. If steps are required in\\na footing, their number should be kept to the minimum possible. 4\\nCourtesy of EFCO Corp.\\nSouth Point water facility, Durham, North Carolina.\\n4 Neville, G.

A value of b = 12 in. is used for\\nwalls loaded out-of-plane; thus, the loads per foot of wall length are simply the input loads.\\nOnly a value of As1 is input, as it is uncommon to have more than two layers of steel in a wall.\\nIf only one layer is used, then input a value of γ = 0. In order to avoid having to laterally tie\\nthe compression reinforcement, the total vertical reinforcement area is limited to 0.01 times\\nthe gross concrete area. The spreadsheet could easily be modiﬁed to neglect the contribution\\nof the compression steel, and if this were done, the 0.01 limit would not have to be applied.\\nExample 18.4\\nWork Example 18.2 using the spreadsheets for Chapters 9 and 10.\\nSOLUTION\\nOpen the Excel spreadsheet for Chapters 9 and 10, and the Rect Col Worksheet. Enter one load\\ncase at a time. Refer to the table of load combinations in Example 18.2, and look under the heading\\nPu and Mu. Only the values ofPu and Mu for loading combination U = 0.9D + 1.6H are shown\\nin the screenshot below. It is not possible in this example to distinguish between the value of\\nAs1 required for load casesU = 0.9D + 1.6H and U = 1.2D + 1.6L + 1.6H, so only the former is\\nshown. Once values are entered forPu, Mu, b (always 12 in. for walls loaded out-of-plane),h,\\nf′\\nc,a n dfy, enter trial values forAs1 (As2 is always zero for walls loaded out-of-plane). Look at the\\ninteraction diagram and see if the loading ‘‘dot’’ is within the contour of the interaction diagram.\\nUse the smaller diagram that has been reduced by theφ factor. If the dot falls well outside the\\ncontour, you may need to increase the wall thickness. In working this problem with the interaction\\ndiagrams in Appendix A, it was necessary to useγ = 0.6. For walls with two steel layers,γ = 0.5 is\\nmore realistic, and this example could be easily worked using this value. The value ofAs1 obtained\\nby trial and error is the total area of steel per foot of wall length. Half goes in each layer, so enter\\nAppendix A, Table A.6, seeking a value close to and exceeding 0.48 in2/ft. Select #5 at 71\\n2 in.\\n(As = 0.49 in2/ft). If the steel is in only one layer, enter a value ofγ = 0. Steel placed in this\\nfashion is less efﬁcient, and often a thicker wall is needed.

A common\\nmethod used to describe prestressing is shown in Figure 19.1, where a row of books has\\nbeen squeezed together by a person’s hands. The resu lting “beam” can carry a downward\\nload as long as the compressive stress from squeezing at the bottom of the “beam” is greater\\nthan the tensile stress there from the moment produced by the weight of the books and the\\nsuperimposed loads. Such a beam has no tensile strength and, thus, no moment resistance until\\nit is squeezed together or prestressed. You might very logically now expand your thoughts to\\na beam consisting of a row of concrete blocks squeezed together and then to a plain concrete\\nbeam with its negligible tensile strength similarly prestressed.\\nThe theory of prestressing is quite simple and has been used for many years in various\\nkinds of structures. For instance, wooden barrels have long been made by putting tightened\\nmetal bands around them, thus compressing the staves together and making a tight container\\nwith resistance to the outward pressures of the enclosed liquids. For concrete beams, prestress-\\ning is primarily used to counteract tension stresses caused by the weight of the members and\\nthe superimposed loads. Should these loads cause a positive moment in a beam, it is possible\\nby prestressing to introduce a negative moment that can counteract part or all of the positive\\nmoment. An ordinary beam has to have sufﬁcient strength to support itself as well as the other\\nloads, but it is possible with prestressing to produce a negative loading that will eliminate the\\neffect of the beam’s weight, thus producing a “weightless beam.”\\nFrom the preceding discussion, it is easy to see why prestressing has captured the imag-\\nination of so many persons and why it has all sorts of possibilities now and in the future.\\nIn the earlier chapters of this book, only a portion of the concrete cross sections of\\nmembers in bending could be considered effective in resisting loads because a large part of\\nthose cross sections were in tension, and thus the concrete cracked. If, however, concrete\\nﬂexural members can be prestressed so that their entire cross sections are kept in compression,\\nthen the properties of the entire sections are available to resist the applied forces.\\nFIGURE 1 9 . 1 Prestressing.\\n567'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 587}, page_content='McCormac c19.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 4:07 P.M.

Page 569\\n19.3 Pretensioning and Posttensioning 569\\nThe cut strands tend to resume their original length, thus compressing the lower part of the\\nbeam and causing a negative bending moment. The positive moment caused by the beam weight\\nand any superimposed gravity loads is directly opposed by the negative moment. Another way\\nof explaining this is to say that a compression stress has been produced in the bottom of the\\nbeam opposite in character to the tensile stress that is caused there by the working loads.\\n19.2 Advantages and Disadvantages of\\nPrestressed Concrete\\nAdvantages\\nAs described in Section 19.1, it is possible with prestressing to utilize the entire cross sections\\nof members to resist loads. Thus, smaller members can be used to support the same loads, or the\\nsame-size members can be used for longer spans. This is a particularly important advantage\\nbecause member weights make up a substantial part of the total design loads of concrete\\nstructures.\\nPrestressed members are crack-free under working loads and, as a result, look better and\\nare more watertight, providing better corrosion protection for the steel. Furthermore, crack-\\nfree prestressed members require less maintenance and last longer than cracked reinforced\\nconcrete members. Therefore, for a large number of structures, prestressed concrete provides\\nthe lowest ﬁrst-cost solution, and when its reduced maintenance is considered, prestressed\\nconcrete provides the lowest overall cost for many additional cases.\\nThe negative moments caused by prestressing produce camber in the members, with\\nthe result that total deﬂections are reduced. Other advantages of prestressed concrete include\\nthe following: reduction in diagonal tension stresses, sections with greater stiffnesses under\\nworking loads, and increased fatigue and impact resistance compared to ordinary reinforced\\nconcrete.\\nDisadvantages\\nPrestressed concrete requires the use of higher-strength concretes and steels and the use of\\nmore complicated formwork, with resulting higher labor costs. Other disadvantages include\\nthe following:\\n1. Closer quality control required in manufacture.\\n2. Losses in the initial prestressing forces. When the compressive forces from prestressing\\nare applied to the concrete, it will shorten somewhat, partially relaxing the cables. The\\nresult is some reduction in cable tension with a resulting loss in prestressing forces.\\nShrinkage and creep of the concrete add to this effect.\\n3. Additional stress conditions must be checked in design, such as the stresses occurring\\nwhen prestress forces are ﬁrst applied and then after prestress losses have taken place,\\nas well as the stresses occurring for different loading conditions.\\n4. Cost of end anchorage devices and end-beam plates that may be required.\\n19.3 Pretensioning and Posttensioning\\nThe two general methods of prestressing are pretensioning and posttensioning. Pretensioning\\nwas illustrated in Section 19.1, where the prestress tendons were tensioned before the concrete\\nwas placed. After the concrete had hardened sufﬁciently, the te ndons were cut and the prestress\\nforce was transmitted to the concrete by bond. This method is particularly well suited for mass'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 589}, page_content='McCormac c19.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 4:07 P.M.

The tendons\\ncan be run for the entire bed lengths and used for casting several beams in a line at the same\\ntime, as shown in Figure 19.3.\\nIn posttensioned construction (see Figure 19.4), the tendons are stressed after the concrete\\nis placed and has gained the desired strength. Plastic or metal tubes, c onduits, sleeves, or\\nsimilar devices with unstressed tendons inside (or later inserted) are located in the form and\\nthe concrete is placed. After the concrete has sufﬁciently hardened, the tendons are stretched\\nand mechanically attached to end anchorage devices to keep the tendons in their stretched\\npositions. Thus, by posttensioning, the prestress forces are transferred to the concrete not by\\nbond but by end bearing.\\nIt is actually possible in posttensioning to have either bonded or unbonded tendons. If\\nbonded, the conduits are often made of aluminum, steel, or other metal sheathing. In addition, it\\nis possible to use steel tubing or rods or rubber cores that are cast in the concrete and removed\\na few hours after the concrete is pl aced. After the steel is tensioned, cement grout is injected\\ninto the duct for bonding. The grout is also useful in protecting the steel from corrosion. If\\nthe tendons are to be unbonded, they should be greased to facilitate tensioning and to protect\\nthem from corrosion. 1\\n19.4 Materials Used for Prestressed Concrete\\nThe materials ordinarily used for prestressed concrete are concrete and high-strength steels. The\\nconcrete used is normally of a higher strength than that used for reinforced concrete members,\\nfor several reasons, including the following:\\n1. The modulus of elasticity of such concretes is higher, with the result that the elastic\\nstrains in the concrete are smaller when the tendons are cut. Thus, the relaxations or\\nlosses in the tendon stresses are smaller.\\n2. In prestressed concrete, the entire members are kept in compression, and thus all the con-\\ncrete is effective in resisting forces. Hence, it is reasonable to pay for a more expensive\\nbut stronger concrete if all of it is going to be used. (In ordinary reinforced concrete\\nbeams, more than half of the cross sections are in tension and, thus, assumed to be\\ncracked. As a result, more than half of a higher-strength concrete used there would\\nbe wasted.)\\n1 Nawy, E. G., 2005, Prestressed Concrete, 5th ed.

Most prestressed work in the United States is of the precast, pretensioned type done at\\nthe prestress yard, where the work can be carefully controlled. Consequently, dependable\\nhigher-strength concrete can readily be obtained.\\n4. For pretensioned work, the higher-strength concretes permit the use of higher bond\\nstresses between the cables and the concrete.\\nHigh-strength steels are n ecessary to produce and keep satisfactory prestress forces in\\nmembers. The strains that occur in these steels during stressing are much greater than those\\nthat can be obtained with ordinary reinforcing steels. As a result, when the concrete elastically\\nshortens in compression and also shortens because of creep and shrinkage, the losses in strain\\nin the steel (and thus stress) represent a smaller percentage of the total stress. Another reason\\nfor using high-strength steels is that a large prestress force can be developed in a small area.\\nEarly work with prestressed concrete using ordinary-strength bars to induce the pre-\\nstressing forces in the concrete resulted in failure because the low stresses that could be\\nput into the bars were completely lost due to the concrete’s shrinkage and creep. Should\\na prestress of 20,000 psi be put into such rods, the resulting strains would be equal to\\n20,000/(29 × 106) = 0.00069. This value is less than the long-term creep and shrinkage strain\\nnormally occurring in concrete, roughly 0.0008, which would completely relieve the stress in\\nthe steel. Should a high-strength steel be stressed to about 150,000 psi and have the same creep\\nand shrinkage, the stress reduction will be of the order of (0.0008)(29 × 106) = 23,000 psi,\\nleaving 150,000 − 23,200 = 126,800 psi in the steel (a loss of only 15.47% of the steel stress).2\\nThree forms of prestressing steel are used: single wires, wire strands, and bars. The\\ngreater the diameter of the wires, the smaller become their strengths and bond to the concrete.\\nAs a result, wires are manufactured with diameters from 0.192 in. up to a maximum of 0.276\\nin. (about 9\\n32 in.). In posttensioning work, large numbers of wires are grouped in parallel into\\ntendons. Strands that are made by twisting wires together are used for most pretensioned work.\\nThey are of the seven-wire type, where a center wire is tightly surrounded by twisting the\\nother six wires helically around it. Strands are manufactured with diameters from 1\\n4 in. to\\n1\\n2 in. Sometimes large, high-strength, heat-treated alloy steel bars are used for posttensioned\\nsections. They are available with diameters running from 3\\n4 in. to 1 3\\n8 in.\\nHigh-strength prestressing steels do not have distinct yield points (see Figure 19.10) as\\ndo the structural carbon reinforcing steels. The practice of considering yield points, however,\\n2 Winter, G., and Nilson, A. H., 1991, Design of Concrete Structures , 11th ed.

The yield stress for wires and strands is usually assumed\\nto be the stress that causes a total elongation of 1% to occur in the steel. For high-strength\\nbars, the yield stress is assumed to occur when a 0.2% permanent strain occurs.\\n19.5 Stress Calculations\\nFor a consideration of stresses in a prestressed rectangular beam, refer to Figure 19.5. For this\\nexample, the prestress tendons are assumed to be straight, although it will later be shown that\\na curved shape is more practical for most beams. The tendons are assumed to be located an\\neccentric distance, e, below the centroidal axis of the beam. As a result, the beam is subjected to\\na combination of direct compression and a moment because of the eccentricity of the prestress.\\nIn addition, there will be a moment from the external load, including the beam’s own weight.\\nThe resulting stress at any point in the beam caused by these three factors can be written as\\nfollows, whereP is the prestressing force:\\nf =− P\\nA ± Pec\\nI ± Mc\\nI\\nIn this expression, P is the prestress force, e is the eccentricity of the prestress force\\nwith respect to the centroid of the cross section, c is the distance from the centroidal axis to\\nthe extreme ﬁber (top or bottom depending on where the stresses are being determined), M is\\nthe applied moment from unfactored loads at the stage at which stresses are being calculated,\\nAis the uncracked concrete cross-sectional area, and I is the moment of inertia of the gross\\nconcrete cross section. In Figure 19.5, a stress diagram is drawn for each of these three items,\\nand all three are combined to give the ﬁnal stress diagram.\\nThe usual practice is to base the stress calculations in the elastic range on the properties\\nof the gross concrete section. The gross section consists of the concrete external dimensions\\nwith no additions made for the transformed area of the steel tendons or subtractions made\\nfor the duct areas in posttensioning.

Both methods\\nare used to prevent the development of negative moments at the beam ends.\\nIn ACI Section 18.3.3, bonded and unbonded prestressed members are designated as\\nbeing Class U, T, or C members. These classiﬁcations are based on computed tensile stresses\\nin members subject to service loads. Class U members are those that are assumed to be\\nuncracked and have maximum tensile stresses ft ≤ 7.5\\n√\\nf ′c. Class C members are those that are\\nassumed to be cracked and have ft > 12\\n√\\nf ′c. Class T members are assumed to be in transition\\nbetween cracked and uncracked members and have maximum tensile stresses > 7.5\\n√\\nf ′c ≤\\n12\\n√\\nf ′c. Prestressed two-way slabs must be designed as Class U sections with ft ≤ 6\\n√\\nf ′c.\\nACI Section 18.3.4 states that for Class U and T members, ﬂexural stresses may be com-\\nputed using the uncracked section properties. For Class C sections, however, it is necessary to\\nuse cracked section properties.\\nExample 19.2 shows the calculations necessary to locate the kern point for the beam of\\nExample 19.1. In addition, the stresses at the top and bottom of the beam ends are computed.\\nIt will be noted that, according to these calculations, the kern point is 4 in. below the middepth\\nof the beam, and it would thus appear that the prestress tendons should be located at the\\nkern point at the beam ends and pushed down to the desired depth farther out in the beam.\\nActually, however, the tendons at the beam ends do not have to be as high as the kern points\\nbecause the ACI Code (18.4.1) permits some tension in the top of the beam when the te ndons\\nare cut. This value is 3\\n√\\nf ′\\nci ,w h e r ef ′\\nci is the strength of the concrete at the time the\\ntendons are cut, as determined by testing concrete cylinders. The subscript i denotes “initial,”\\nmeaning at initial release of the prestressing tendon, before the concrete gains its full 28-day\\nstrength. This permissible value equals about 40% of the cracking strength or modulus of\\nrupture of the concrete\\n(\\n7.5\\n√\\nf ′\\nci\\n⎡\\nat that time. The stress at the bottom of the beam, which is\\ncompressive, is permitted to go as high as 0.60 f ′\\nci .\\nThe code actually permits tensile stresses at the ends of simple beams to go as high\\nas 6\\n√\\nf ′\\nci . These allowable tensile values are applicable to the stresses that occur immediately\\nafter the transfer of the prestressing forces and after the losses occur from elastic shortening\\nof the concrete and relaxation of the tendons and anchorage seats. It is further assumed that\\nthe time-dependent losses of creep and shrinkage have not occurred. A discussion of these\\nvarious losses is presented in Section 19.7 of this chapter. If the calculated tensile stresses are\\ngreater than the permissible values, it is necessary to use some additional bonded reinforcing\\n(prestressed or unprestressed) to resist the total tensile force in the concrete computed on the\\nbasis of an uncracked section.\\nSection 18.4.2 of the code provides allowable stresses at service loads for Class U and\\nClass T members after all prestress losses have occurred. An extreme ﬁber compression stress\\nequal to 0.60f ′\\nc is permitted for prestress plus sustained loads. The allowable compression\\nstress for prestress plus total loads is 0.70 f ′\\nc. In effect, the ACI here provides a one-third\\nincrease in allowable compression stress when a large percentage of the service loads are\\ndeemed to be transient or of short duration.\\nThe allowable tensile stress at ends of simply supported members immediately after\\nprestress transfer is 6\\n√\\nf ′\\nci . Section 18.4.3 of the code allows higher permissible stresses than\\nthose here under certain conditions. The commentary on this section of the code states that it is\\nthe intent of the code’s writers to permit higher stress values when justiﬁed by the development\\nof newer and better products, materials, and prestress techniques.

From the viewpoint of formwork alone, rectangular sections are\\nthe most economical, but more complicated shapes, such as I’s and T’s, will require smaller\\nquantities of concrete and prestressing steel to carry the same loads and, as a result, they\\nfrequently have the lowest overall costs.\\nIf a member is to be made only one time, a cross section requiring simple formwork (thus,\\noften rectangular) will probably be used. For instance, simple formwork is essential for most\\ncast-in-place work. Should, however, the forms be used a large number of times to make many\\nidentical members, more complicated cross sections, such as I’s and T’s, channels, or boxes,\\nwill be used. For such sections, the cost of the formwork as a percentage of each member’s\\ntotal cost will be greatly reduced. Several types of commonly used prestressed sections are\\nshown in Figure 19.8. The same general theory used for the determination of stresses and\\nﬂexural strengths applies to shapes such as these, as it does to rectangular sections.\\nThe usefulness of a particular section depends on the simplicity and reusability of the\\nformwork, the appearance of the sections, the degree of difﬁculty of placing the concrete, and\\nthe theoretical properties of the cross section. The greater the amount of concrete located near\\nthe extreme ﬁbers of a beam, the greater will be the lever arm between the C and T forces\\nand, thus, the greater the resisting moment.

In addition, the webs must be sufﬁciently large to resist shear\\nand to allow the proper placement of the concrete and at the same time be sufﬁciently thick\\nto avoid buckling.\\nA prestressed single T, such as the one shown in Figure 19.8(a), is often a very economical\\nsection because a large pr oportion of the concrete is pl aced in the compression ﬂange, where it\\nis quite effective in resisting compressive forces. The double T shown in Figure 19.8(b) is used\\nfor schools, ofﬁce buildings, stores, and so on and is probably the most used prestressed section\\nin the United States today. The total width of the ﬂange provided by a double T is in the range of\\nabout 5 ft to 8 ft, and spans of 30 ft to 50 ft are common. You can see that a ﬂoor or roof system\\ncan be erected easily and quickly by placing a series of precast double T’s side by side ⊤⊤ ⊤⊤\\n⊤⊤ . The sections serve as both the beams and slabs for the ﬂoor or roof system. Single T’s are\\nnormally used for heavier loads and longer spans up to as high as 100 ft or 120 ft. Double T’s\\nfor such spans would be very heavy and difﬁcult to handle. The single T is not used as much\\ntoday as it was in the recent past because of stab ility difﬁculties in both shipping and erection.\\nThe I and box sections, shown in parts (c) and (d) of Figure 19.8, have a larger proportion\\nof their concrete placed in their ﬂanges, with the result that larger moments of inertia are pos-\\nsible (as compared to rectangular sections with the same amounts of concrete and prestressing\\ntendons). The formwork, however, is complicated, and the placing of concrete is difﬁcult. Box\\ngirders are frequently used for bridge spans. Unsymmetrical I’s [Figure 19.8(e)], with large\\nbottom ﬂanges to contain the tendons and small top ﬂanges, may be economical for certain\\ncomposite sections where they are used together with a slab poured in place to provide the\\ncompression ﬂange. A similar situation is shown in Figure 19.8(f), where an inverted T is used\\nwith a cast-in-place slab.\\nMany variations of these sections are used, such as the channel section shown in\\nFigure 19.8(g). Such a section might be made by blocking out the ﬂanges of a double-T form\\nas shown, and the resulting members might be used for stadium seats or similar applications.\\n19.7 Prestress Losses\\nThe ﬂexural stresses calculated for the beams of Examples 19.1 and 19.2 were based on initial\\nstresses in the prestress tendons. These stresses, however, become smaller with time (over a\\nperiod of roughly ﬁve years) b ecause of several factors. These factors, which are discussed in\\nthe paragraphs to follow, include:\\n1. Elastic shortening of the concrete\\n2. Shrinkage and creep of the concrete\\n3. Relaxation or creep in the tendons\\n4. Slippage in posttensioning end anchorage systems\\n5. Friction along the ducts used in posttensioning\\nAlthough it is possible to calculate prestress losses individually for each of the factors\\nlisted, it is usually more practical and often just as satisfactory to use single lump-sum estimates\\nfor all the items together. There are just too many interrelated factors affecting the estimates\\nto achieve accuracy.\\nSuch lump-sum estimates of total prestress losses are applicable only to average pre-\\nstressed members made with normal concrete, construction procedures, and quality control.\\nShould conditions be decidedly different from these and/or if the project is extremely signiﬁ-\\ncant, it would be well to consider making detailed loss estimates such as those introduced in\\nthe next few paragraphs.\\nThe ultimate strength of a prestressed member is almost completely controlled by the\\ntensile strength and cross-sectional area of the cables. Consequently, losses in prestress will'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 599}, page_content='McCormac c19.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 4:07 P.M.

However, losses in prestress will cause\\nmore cracking to occur under working loads, with the result that deﬂections will be larger.\\nFurthermore, the member’s shear and fatigue strength will be somewhat reduced.\\nElastic Shortening of the Concrete\\nWhen the tendons are cut for a pretensioned member, the prestress force is transferred to the\\nconcrete, with the result that the concrete is put in compression and shortens, thus permitting\\nsome relaxation or shortening of the tendons. The stress in the concrete adj acent to the tendons\\ncan be computed as described in the preceding examples. The strain in the concrete, ϵc,w h i c h\\nequals fc/Ec, is assumed due to bond to equal the steel strain, ϵs . Thus, the loss in prestress\\ncan be computed as ϵs Es . An average value of prestress loss in pretensioned members because\\nof elastic shortening is about 3% of the initial value.\\nAn expression for the loss of prestress because of elastic shortening of the concrete can\\nbe derived as shown in the paragraphs to follow.\\nIt can be seen that the compressive strain in the concrete from prestress must equal the\\nlessening of the steel strain\\nϵc = /Delta1ϵs\\nThese values can be written in terms of stresses as follows:\\nfc\\nEc\\n= /Delta1fs\\nEs\\nthus, we can write\\n/Delta1fs = Es fc\\nEc\\n= nfc\\nwhere fc is the stress in the concrete at the level of the tendon centroid after transfer of stresses\\nfrom the cables.\\nIf we express /Delta1fs as being the initial tendon stress, fsi , minus the tendon stress after\\ntransfer, we can write\\nfsi − fs = nfc\\nThen, letting P0 be the initial total cable stress and Pf the stress afterward, we obtain\\nP0 − Pf = n Pf\\nAc\\nAps\\nP0 = n\\nPf\\nAc\\nAps + Pf\\nP0 = Pf\\n(nAps\\nAc\\n+ 1\\n⎡\\n=\\nPf\\nAc\\n(nAps + Ac )\\nThen\\nfc = P0\\nAc + Aps\\n= approximately P0\\nAg\\nand ﬁnally\\n/Delta1fs = nfc = nP0\\nAg\\na value that can easily be calculated.\\nFor posttensioned members, the situation is a little more involved b ecause it is rather\\ncommon to stress a few of the strands at a time and connect them to the end plates. As a\\nresult, the losses vary, with the greatest losses occurring in the ﬁrst strands stressed and the\\nleast losses occurring in the last strands stressed. For this reason, an average loss may be'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 600}, page_content='McCormac c19.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 4:07 P.M.

It is, by the way, often possible to calculate the expected losses in\\neach set of te ndons and overstress them by that amount so the net losses will be close to zero.\\nShrinkage and Creep of the Concrete\\nThe losses in prestressing because of the shrinkage and creep in the concrete are quite variable.\\nFor one thing, the amount of shrinkage that occurs in concrete varies from almost zero up to\\nabout 0.0005 in./in. (depending on dampness and on the age of the concrete when it is loaded),\\nwith an average value of about 0.0003 in./in. being the usual approximation.\\nThe loss in prestress from shrinkage can be said to equal ϵsh Es ,w h e r eϵsh is the shrinkage\\nstrain of the concrete. A recommended value of ϵsh is given in Zia et al.; it is to be determined\\nby taking the basic shrinkage strain times a correction factor based on the volume (V)-to-surface\\n(S) ratio times a relative humidity correction ( H).3\\nϵsh = (0.00055)\\n(\\n1 − 0.06 V\\nS\\n⎡\\n(1.5 − 0.15H )\\nShould the member be posttensioned, an additional multiplier is provided in Zia et al.\\nto take into account the time between the end of the moist curing until the prestressing forces\\nare applied.\\nThe amount of creep in the concrete depends on several factors, which have been pre-\\nviously discussed in this text and can vary from one to ﬁve times the instantaneous elastic\\nshortening. Prestress forces are usually applied to pretensioned members much earlier in the\\nage of the concrete than for posttensioned members. Pretensioned members are normally cast\\nin a bed at the prestress yard, where the speed of production of members is an important eco-\\nnomic matter. The owner wants to tension the steel, place the concrete, and take the members\\nout of the prestress bed as quickly as the concrete gains sufﬁcient strength so that work can\\nstart on the next set of members. As a result, creep and shrinkage are larger, as are the resulting\\nlosses. Average losses are about 6% for pretensioned members and about 5% for posttensioned\\nmembers.\\nThe losses in cable stresses due to concrete creep strain can be determined by multiplying\\nan experimentally determined creep coefﬁcient Ct by nfc.\\n/Delta1fs = Ct nfc\\nIn Zia et al., a value of Ct = 2.0 is recommended for pretensioned sections, while 1.6 is\\nrecommended for posttensioned ones. These values should be reduced by 20% if lightweight\\nconcrete is used. The value fc is deﬁned as the stress in the concrete adjacent to the centroid\\nof the tendons due to the initial prestress (−P/A) and due to the permanent dead loads that\\nare applied to the member after prestressing (−Pec/I ),w h e r ee is measured from the centroid\\nof the section to the centroid of the tendons.\\nRelaxation or Creep in the Tendons\\nThe plastic ﬂow or relaxation of steel tendons is quite small when the stresses are low, but the\\npercentage of relaxation increases as stresses become higher. In general, the estimated losses\\nrun from about 2% to 3% of the initial stresses. The amount of these losses actually varies\\nquite a bit for different steels and should be determined from test data available from the steel\\nmanufacturer in question. A formula is available with which this loss can be computed.\\n3 Zia, P., Preston, H. K., Scott, N. L., and Workman, E.

Page 582\\n582 CHAPTER 1 9 Prestressed Concrete\\nSlippage in Posttensioning End Anchorage Systems\\nWhen the jacks are released and the prestress forces are transferred to the end anchorage\\nsystem, a little slippage of the tendons occurs. The amount of the slippage depends on the\\nsystem used and tends to vary from about 0.10 in. to 0.20 in. Such deformations are quite\\nimportant if the members and thus the tendons are short, but if they are long, the percentage\\nis much less important.\\nFriction along the Ducts Used in Posttensioning\\nThere are losses in posttensioning because of friction between the te ndons and the surrounding\\nducts. In other words, the stress in the tendons gradually falls off as the distance from the\\ntension points increases because of friction between the tendons and the surrounding material.\\nThese losses are the result of the so-called length and curvature effects.\\nThe length effect is the friction that would have existed if the cable had been straight\\nand not curved. Actually, it is impossible to have a perfectly straight duct in posttensioned\\nconstruction, and the result is friction, called the length effect or sometimes the wobble effect.\\nThe magnitude of this friction is dependent on the stress in the tendons, their length, the\\nworkmanship for the particular member in question, and the coefﬁcient of friction between the\\nmaterials.\\nThe curvature effect is the amount of friction that occurs in addition to the unplanned\\nwobble effect. The resulting loss is due to the coefﬁcient of friction between the materials\\ncaused by the pressure on the concrete from the tendons, which is dependent on the stress and\\nthe angle change in the curved tendons.\\nIt is possible to reduce frictional losses substantially in prestressing by several meth-\\nods. These include jacking from both ends, overstressing the tendons initially, and lubricating\\nunbonded cables.\\nThe ACI Code (18.6.2.2) requires that frictional losses for posttensioned members be\\ncomputed with wobble and curvature coefﬁcients experimentally obtained and veriﬁed during\\nthe prestressing operation. Furthermore, the code provides Equations 18-1 and 18-2 (in Section\\n18.6.2.1) for making the calculations. The ACI Commentary (R18.6.2) provides values of the\\nfriction coefﬁcients for use in the equations.\\n19.8 Ultimate Strength of Prestressed Sections\\nConsiderable emphasis is given to the ultimate strength of prestressed sections, the objective\\nbeing to obtain a satisfactory factor of safety against collapse. You might wonder why it is\\nnecessary in prestress work to considerboth working-stress and ultimate-strength situations.\\nThe answer lies in the tremendous change that occurs in a prestressed member’s behavior after\\ntensile cracks occur. Before the cracks begin to form, the entire cross section of a prestressed\\nmember is effective in resisting forces, but after the tensile cracks begin to develop, the\\ncracked part is not effective in resisting tensile forces. Cracking is usually assumed to occur\\nwhen calculated tensile stresses equal the modulus of rupture of the concrete (about 7.5\\n√\\nf ′c).\\nAnother question that might enter your mind at this time is this: What effect do the\\nprestress forces have on the ultimate strength of a section? The answer to the question is quite\\nsimple. An ultimate-strength analysis is based on the assumption that the prestressing strands\\nare stressed above their yield point. If the strands have yielded, the tensile side of the section\\nhas cracked and the theoretical ultimate resisting moment is the same as for a nonprestressed\\nbeam constructed with the same concrete and reinforcing.\\nThe theoretical calculation of ultimate capacities for prestressed sections is not as routine\\nas it is for ordinary reinforced concrete members.

Despite this fact, the strength\\nmethod for determining the ultimate moment capacities of sections checks rather well with\\nload tests as long as the steel percentage is sufﬁciently small as to ensure a tensile failure and\\nas long as bonded strands are being considered.\\nIn the expressions used here, fps is the average stress in the prestressing steel at the\\ndesign load. This stress is used in the calculations because the prestressing steels usually used\\nin prestressed beams do not have well-deﬁned yield points (i.e., the ﬂat portions that are\\ncommon to stress–strain curves for ordinary structural steels). Unless the yield points of these\\nsteels are determined from detailed studies, their values are normally speciﬁed. For instance, the\\nACI Code (18.7.2) states that the following approximate expression may be used for calculating\\nfps . In this expression, fpu is the ultimate strength of the prestressing steel, ρp is the percentage\\nof prestress reinforcing Aps /bdp,a n d fse is the effective stress in the prestressing steel after\\nlosses. If more accurate stress values are available, they may be used instead of the speciﬁed\\nvalues. In no case may the resulting values be taken as more than the speciﬁed yield strength\\nfpy ,o r fse + 60,000.

For this situation,\\nthe results obtained with ACI Equation 18-3 are not conservative, thus explaining why the ACI\\nprovides the 0.17 limit.\\nShould the compression reinforcing be neglected in using the equation, ω′ will equal zero\\nand the term in brackets may be less than 0.17. Should d′ be large, the strain in the compression\\nsteel may be considerably less than the yield strain, and as a result the compression steel will\\nnot inﬂuencefps as favorably as implied by the equation.

Actually, a slightly more accurate value of fps and, thus, of the moment capacity of\\nthe section can be obtained by calculating the strain in the prestress strands because of the\\nprestressing and adding to it the strain from the ultimate moment. This latter strain can be\\ndetermined from the values ofa and the strain diagram, as frequently used in earlier chapters\\nfor checking to see if tensile failures control in reinforced concrete beams. With the total\\nstrain, a more accurate cable stress can be obtained by referring to the stress–strain curve for\\nthe prestressing steel being used. Such a curve is shown in Figure 19.10.\\nThe analysis described herein is satisfactory for pretensioned beams or for bonded post-\\ntensioned beams but is not so good for unbonded posttensioned members. In these latter beams,\\nthe steel can slip with respect to the concrete; as a result, the steel stress is almost constant\\nthroughout the member. The calculations forMu for such members are less accurate than for\\nbonded members. Unless some ordinary reinforcing bars are added to these members, large\\ncracks may form, which are not attractive and which can lead to some corrosion of the prestress\\nstrands.\\nIf a prestressed beam is satisfactorily designed with service loads, then checked by\\nstrength methods and found to have insufﬁcient strength to resist the factored loads (Mu =\\n1.2MD + 1.6ML), nonprestressed reinforcement may be added to increase the factor of safety.\\nThe increase in T from these bars is assumed to equal As fy (ACI 18.7.3). The code (18.8.2)\\nfurther states that the total amount of prestressed and nonprestressed reinforcement shall be\\nsufﬁcient to develop an ultimate moment equal to at least 1.2 times the cracking moment of the\\nsection. This cracking moment is calculated with the modulus of rupture of the concrete, except\\nfor ﬂexural members with a shear and ﬂexural strength equal to at least twice that required to\\nsupport the factored loads and for two-way, unbonded posttensioned slabs. This additional steel\\nalso will serve to reduce cracks. (The 1.2 requirement may be waived for two-way unbonded\\nposttensioned slabs and for ﬂexural members with shear and ﬂexural strength at least equal to\\ntwice that required by ACI Section 9.2.)\\nUnit stress, k\\nUnit strain, %\\nF I G U R E 19.10Typical stress–strain curve for\\nhigh-tensile steel wire.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 605}, page_content='McCormac c19.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 4:07 P.M. Page 586\\n586 CHAPTER 1 9 Prestressed Concrete\\n19.9 Deﬂections\\nThe deﬂections of prestressed concrete beams must be calculated very carefully. Some members\\nthat are completely satisfactory in all other respects are not satisfactory for practical use because\\nof the magnitudes of their deﬂections.\\nIn previous chapters, one method used for limiting deﬂections was to specify minimum\\ndepths for various types of members (see Table 4.1 in Chapter 4). These minimum depths,\\nhowever, are applicable only to nonprestressed sections. The actual deﬂection calculations are\\nmade as they are for members made of other materials, such as structural steel, reinforced\\nconcrete, and so on. However, the same problem exists for reinforced concrete members, and\\nthat is the difﬁculty of determining the modulus of elasticity to be used in the calculations. The\\nmodulus varies with age, with different stress levels, and with other factors. Usually the gross\\nmoments of inertia are used for immediate deﬂection calculations for members whose calculated\\nextreme ﬁber stresses at service loads in the precompressed tensile zone are ≤ 7.5\\n√\\nf ′c (ACI\\n18.3.3). Transformed I values may be used for other situations, as described in ACI Sections\\n18.3.3, 18.3.4, and 18.3.5.\\nThe deﬂection from the force in a set of straight tendons is considered ﬁrst in this section,\\nwith reference being made to Figure 19.11(a). The prestress forces cause a negative moment\\nequal to Pe and, thus, an upward deﬂection or camber of the beam. The centerline deﬂection\\ncan be calculated by taking moments at the point desired when the conjugate beam is loaded\\nwith theM/EI diagram. At the centerline the deﬂection equals\\n−\\n(Pel\\n2EI\\n⎡(l\\n2 − l\\n4\\n⎡\\n=− Pel2\\n8EI ↑\\nShould the cables not be straight, the deﬂection will be different b ecause of the different\\nnegative moment diagram produced by the cable force. If the cables are bent down or curved,\\nas shown in parts (b) and (c) of Figure 19.11, the conjugate beam can again be applied to\\ncompute the deﬂections.

From the pre-\\nceding example, it can be seen that, not counting external loads, the beam is initially cambered\\nupward by 0.496 in.; as time goes by, this camber increases because of creep in the concrete.\\nSuch a camber is often advantageous in offsetting deﬂections caused by the superimposed\\nloads. In some members, however, the camber can be quite large, particularly for long spans\\nand where lightweight aggregates are used. If this camber is too large, the results can be quite\\ndetrimental to the structure (warping of ﬂoors, damage to rooﬁng, cracking and warping of\\npartitions, etc.).\\nTo illustrate one problem that can occur, it is assumed that the roof of a school is being\\nconstructed by placing 50-ft double T’s made with a lightweight aggregate side by side over\\na classroom. The resulting cambers may be rather large, and, worse, they may not be equal\\nin the different sections. It then becomes necessary to force the different sections to the same\\ndeﬂection and tie them together in some fashion so that a smooth surface is provided for\\nrooﬁng. Once the surface is even, the members may be connected by welding together metal\\ninserts, such as angles that were cast in the edges of the different sections for this purpose.\\nBoth reinforced concrete members and prestressed members with overhanging or can-\\ntilevered ends often have rather large deﬂections.

For this\\nreason, many designers try to avoid cantilevered members in prestressed construction.\\n19.10 Shear in Prestressed Sections\\nWeb reinforcement for prestressed sections is handled in a manner similar to that used for a\\nconventional reinforced concrete beam. In the expressions that follow, bw is the web width or\\nthe diameter of a circular section and dp is the distance from the extreme ﬁber in compression\\nto the centroid of the tensile reinforcement. Should the r eaction introduce compression into the\\nend region of a prestressed member, sections of the beam located at distances less than h/2\\nfrom the face of the support may be designed for the shear computed at h/2, where h is the\\noverall thickness of the member.\\nvu = Vu\\nφbw dp\\nThe code (11.3) provides two methods for estimating the shear strength that the concrete\\nof a prestressed section can resist. There is an approximate method, which can be used only\\nwhen the effective prestress force is equal to at least 40% of the tensile strength of the ﬂexural\\nreinforcement, fpu , and a more detailed analysis, which can be used regardless of the magnitude\\nof the effective prestress force. These methods are discussed in the paragraphs to follow.\\nApproximate Method\\nWith this method, the nominal shear capacity of a prestressed section can be taken as\\nVc =\\n(\\n0.6λ\\n√\\nf ′c +\\n700Vu dp\\nMu\\n⎡\\nbw d (ACI Equation 11-9)\\nThe code (11.3.2) states that regardless of the value given by this equation, Vc need not\\nbe taken as less than 2 λ√\\nf ′cbw d, nor may it be larger than 5 λ√\\nf ′cbw d. In this expression, Vu\\nis the maximum design shear at the section being considered, Mu is the design moment at\\nthe same section occurring simultaneously with Vu ,a n d d is the distance from the extreme\\ncompression ﬁber to the centroid of the prestressed tendons. The value of Vu dp /Mu is limited\\nto a maximum value of 1.0.\\nMore Detailed Analysis\\nIf a more detailed analysis is desired (it will have to be used if the effective prestressing force\\nis less than 40% of the tensile strength of the ﬂexural reinforcement), the nominal shear force\\ncarried by the concrete is considered to equal the smaller of Vci or Vcw , to be deﬁned here.\\nThe term Vci represents the nominal shear strength of a member provided by the concrete\\nwhen diagonal cracking results from combined shear and moment. The term Vcw represents\\nthe nominal shear strength of the member provided by the concrete when diagonal cracking\\nresults from excessive principal tensile stress in the concrete. In both expressions to follow, d\\nis the distance from the extreme compression ﬁber to the centroid of the prestressed tendons\\nor is 0.8 h, whichever is greater (ACI 11.3.3.2).\\nThe estimated shear capacity, Vci , can be computed by the following expression, given\\nby the ACI Code (11.3.3.1):\\nVci = 0.6λ\\n√\\nf ′cbw dp + Vd + Vi Mcr\\nMmax\\nbut need not be taken as less than 1.7 λ\\n√\\nf ′cbw d\\n(ACI Equation 11-10)'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 610}, page_content='McCormac c19.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 4:07 P.M.

(Should the centroid be in the ﬂange, fpc is to be computed at\\nthe junction of the web and ﬂange.) Vp is the vertical component of the effective prestress at\\nthe section under consideration. Alternately, the code (11.3.3.2) states that Vcw may be taken\\nas the shear force that corresponds to a multiple of dead load plus live load, which results in\\na calculated principal tensile stress equal to 4 λ\\n√\\nf ′c at the centroid of the member or at the\\nintersection of the ﬂange and web if the centroid falls in the web.\\nA further comment should be made here about the computation of fpc for pretensioned\\nmembers, since it is affected by the transfer length. The code (11.3.4) states that the transfer\\nlength can be taken as 50 diameters for strand tendons and 100 diameters for wire tendons.\\nThe prestress force may be assumed to vary linearly from zero at the end of the tendon to a\\nmaximum at the aforesaid transfer distance. If the value of h/2 is less than the transfer length,\\nit is necessary to consider the reduced prestress when Vcw is calculated (ACI 11.3.4).\\n19.11 Design of Shear Reinforcement\\nShould the computed value of Vu exceed φVc , the area of vertical stirrups (the code does not\\npermit inclined stirrups or bent-up bars in prestressed members) must not be less than Av as\\ndetermined by the following expression from the code (11.4.7.2):\\nVs =\\nAv fyd\\ns (ACI Equation 11-15)\\nAs in conventional reinforced concrete design, a minimum area of shear reinforcing is\\nrequired at all points where Vu is greater than 1\\n2 φVc .

Several of these items are\\nbrieﬂy mentioned in the paragraphs that follow.\\nStresses in End Blocks\\nThe part of a prestressed member around the end anchorages of the steel tendons is called the\\nend block. In this region, the prestress forces are transferred from very concentrated areas out\\ninto the whole beam cross section. It has been found that the length of transfer for posttensioned\\nmembers is less than the height of the beam and in fact is probably much less.\\nFor posttensioned members, there is direct-bearing compression at the end anchorage;\\ntherefore, solid end blocks are usually used there to spread out the concentrated prestress\\nforces. To prevent bursting of the block, either wire mesh or a grid of vertical and horizontal\\nreinforcing bars is placed near the end face of the beam. In addition, both vertical and horizontal\\nreinforcing is placed thr oughout the block.\\nFor pretensioned members where the prestress is transferred to the concrete by bond over\\na distance approximately equal to the beam depth, a solid end block is probably not n ecessary,\\nbut spaced stirrups are needed. A great deal of information on the subject of end block stresses\\nfor posttensioned and pretensioned members is available. 4\\nComposite Construction\\nPrecast prestressed sections are frequently used in buildings and bridges in combination with\\ncast-in-place concrete. Should such members be properly designed for shear transfer so the two\\nparts will act together as a unit, they are called composite sections. Examples of such members\\nwere previously shown in parts (e) and (f) of Figure 19.8. In composite construction, the parts\\nthat are difﬁcult to form and that contain most of the reinforcing are precast, whereas the slabs\\nand perhaps the top of the beams, which are relatively easy to form, are cast in place.\\nThe precast sections are normally designed to s upport their own weights plus the green\\ncast-in-place concrete in the slabs plus any other loads applied during construction. The dead\\nand live loads applied after the slab hardens are supported by the composite section. The\\ncombination of the two parts will yield a composite section that has a very large moment\\nof inertia and thus a very large resisting moment. It is usually quite economical to use (a)\\na precast prestressed beam made with a high-strength concrete and (b) a slab made with an\\nordinary grade of concrete. If this practice is followed, it will be n ecessary to account for the\\ndifferent moduli of elasticity of the two materials in calculating the composite properties (thus\\nit becomes a transformed area problem).\\n4 Nawy, Prestressed Concrete, p. 173.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 615}, page_content='McCormac c19.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 4:07 P.M. Page 596\\n596 CHAPTER 1 9 Prestressed Concrete\\nContinuous Members\\nContinuous prestressed sections may be cast in place completely with their tendons running\\ncontinuously from one end to the other. It should be realized for such members that where the\\nservice loads tend to cause positive moments, the tendons should produce negative moments\\nand vice versa. This means that the tendons should be below the member’s center of gravity in\\nnormally positive moment regions and above the center of gravity in normally negative moment\\nregions. To produce the desired stress distributions, it is possible to use curved tendons and\\nmembers of constant cross section or straight tendons with members of variable cross section.\\nIn Figure 19.14, several continuous beams of these types are shown.\\nAnother type of continuous section that has been used very su ccessfully in the United\\nStates, particularly for bridge construction, involves the use of pr ecast prestressed mem-\\nbers made into continuous sections with cast-in-place concrete and regular reinforcing steel.\\nFigure 19.14(d) shows such a case. For such construction, the precast section resists a portion\\nof the dead load, while the live load and the dead load that is applied after the cast-in-place\\nconcrete hardens are resisted by the continuous member.\\nPartial Prestressing\\nDuring the early days of prestressed concrete, the objective of the designer was to proportion\\nmembers that could never be subject to tension when service loads were applied. Such members\\nare said to be fully prestressed. Subsequent investigations of fully prestressed members have\\nshown that they often have an appreciable amount of extra strength. As a result, many designers\\nnow believe that certain amounts of tensile stresses can be permitted under service loads.\\nMembers that are permitted to have some tensile stresses are said to be partially prestressed.\\nA major advantage of a partially prestressed beam is a decrease in camber. This is\\nparticularly important when the beam load or the dead load is quite low compared to the total\\ndesign load.\\nTo provide additional safety for partially prestressed beams, it is common practice to\\nadd some conventional reinforcement. This reinforcement will increase the ultimate ﬂexural\\nstrength of the members as well as help to carry the tensile stresses in the beam.5\\n(a) Curved tendons, member\\n with constant corss section\\n(b) Straight tendons, member\\n with variable cross section\\n(c) Straight tendons, haunched section (d) Precast sections made into\\n continuous sections\\ncast-in-place joints\\nF I G U R E 19.14Continuous beams.\\n5 Lin, T.

Concrete\\nmasonry is masonry constructed with concrete block or, more accurately, concrete masonry\\nunits, or CMUs. Masonry can be either reinforced or unreinforced, but this chapter is limited\\nto reinforced masonry. It can also be designed by allowable stress design or strength design,\\nbut this chapter is limited to strength design. Masonry design and construction is governed by\\nBuilding Code Requirements and Speciﬁcation for Masonry Structures(ACI 530/ACI 530.1) 1\\nand, in many jurisdictions, the International Building Code (IBC).2 These codes change every\\nthree years on a similar schedule to that of the ACI 318 code.\\n20.2 Masonry Materials\\nConcrete Masonry Units\\nProperties of concrete masonry units are governed by ASTM C90. This speciﬁcation applies to\\nhollow and solid load-bearing CMUs ordinarily used in the construction of concrete masonry.\\nThe standard limits the thickness of face shells and webs according to the wall thickness of the\\nunits. A good source of information on CMUs is published by the National Concrete Masonry\\nAssociation3 (ncma.org) in the NCMA TEK series. See NCMA TEK 1-1E (2007) for more\\non CMU standards. Other requirements for CMUs are unit compressive strength (1900 psi\\naverage for three units, 1700 psi minimum for a single unit). For example, if three CMUs are\\ntested for net area compressive strength and the results are 1750 psi, 1920 psi, and 2010 psi,\\nthe test would fail. Although no test value falls below 1700 psi, the average of these values\\nis 1893 psi, which is below 1900 psi. Rarely is it necessary to specify a compressive strength\\ngreater than the minimum value, and cost and availability of units with higher strengths are\\nsometimes a problem if a higher strength is speciﬁed.\\nface shells\\nwebs\\nwall thickness\\n1 Building Code Requirements and Speciﬁcation for Masonry Structures(ACI 530/ACI 530.1) (Farmington Hills, MI: American\\nConcrete Institute).\\n2 International Building Code, 2012 (Country Club Hills, IL: International Codes Council [ICC]).\\n3 National Concrete Masonry Association, NCMA, 13750 Sunrise V alley Drive, Herndon, Virginia.\\n602'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 622}, page_content='McCormac c20.tex V2 - January 10, 2013 8:55 A.M. Page 603\\n20.2 Masonry Materials 603\\nASTM C904 also limits the maximum water absorption of units. Absorption is a measure\\nof the total water required to ﬁll all voids within the net volume of concrete. It is determined\\nfrom the weight-per-unit-volume difference between saturated and oven-dry concrete masonry\\nunits. Lightweight units are permitted higher absorption values than medium- or normal-weight\\nunits because their aggregates absorb more water.\\nUnit dimensions are given in terms of nominal values. That is, a CMU with nominal\\ndimensions of 8 in. × 8i n . × 16 in. is actually 7 5\\n8 in. × 75\\n8 in. × 155\\n8 in. When a 3\\n8 -in.\\nmortar-joint thickness is added to the actual dimension, the result is the nominal dimension.\\nFinally, the drying shrinkage of CMUs is limited to 0.065%, according to ASTM C 426,\\nTest Method for Linear Drying Shrinkage of Concrete Masonry Units. If CMUs shrink too\\nmuch when they dry, walls constructed from them will be more likely to undergo shrinkage\\ncracks.\\nMortar\\nThe question is often asked, Does mortar hold masonry units apart or hold them together?\\nActually, mortar does both. It allows the mason to lay irregular masonry units into a wall that\\nhas character, texture, and longevity. Mortar joints are usually 3\\n8 in. thick, but the bricklayer\\ncan vary their thickness to accommodate variations of unit dimensions. So in this sense, mortar\\nholds units apart. Mortar also holds units together by bonding units to each other, resu lting in\\nboth ﬂexural and direct tensile strength. For reinforced masonry, such tensile strength is not\\nas important as it is for unreinforced masonry, but it is still important. Mortar is pl aced on\\nthe masonry units with a hand trowel. The horizontal joints, called bed joints, are usually laid\\nin “face-shell” bedding. This means that the mortar is placed only on the face shells, not the\\nwebs. The vertical joints in masonry construction are called head joints. These joints are not\\nusually ﬁlled completely with mortar either. They are usually ﬁlled only to a depth about equal\\nto the thickness of the face shells on both faces of the wall.\\nRunning bond construction\\nmasonry wall.

Mortar projections,\\ncalled fins, are the result of mortar in\\nhorizontal joints (bed joints) extruding\\nlaterally during placement of units.\\nConcrete masonry wall with mortar extrusions into the cell.\\nMortar is speciﬁed under ASTM C270. 5 There are three cementitious systems included\\nin this standard: cement and lime, masonry cement, and mortar cement. Cement lime mortar\\nconsists of a mixture of cement (e.g., portland cement, blended cement), hydrated lime (soft,\\nwhite powder, Ca(OH)2, obtained by the action of water on lime), sand, water, and sometimes\\nadmixtures. Masonry cements are a blend of portland or other cements, plasticizing agents,\\nﬁllers, and other materials that are intended to enhance the performance of the mortar. Limits are\\nplaced on its air content, especially when it is used in reinforced masonry. Mortar cement is a\\nsuperior masonry cement that is required to meet additional ﬂexural bond strength requirements\\nnot expected of masonry cement. As a result, mortar cement is permitted in high seismic areas\\n(seismic design categories D and higher), unlike masonry cement.\\n5 Ibid.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 624}, page_content='McCormac c20.tex V2 - January 10, 2013 8:55 A.M. Page 605\\n20.2 Masonry Materials 605\\nMortar is classiﬁed into types. The mortar types are designated M, S, N, O, and K. This\\nodd set of letters actually comes from every second letter of the words MASON WORK. Type\\nM mortar is the strongest, followed by Type S and Type N. Type O and Type K mortars are\\nnot included in the ACI 530 Code. Type M mortar, while being the strongest, is not the best\\nchoice for most masonry construction. The vast majority of masonry is constructed from Type\\nS or Type N mortar. Type S or Type M is required for seismic design categories D (SDC D)\\nand higher.\\nMortar is speciﬁed either by proportion or by property, but not both. If the designer\\ndoes not specify which of these he or she is using, the default is by proportion. Specifying by\\nproportion is analogous to baking a cake from a recipe. The type and quantity of ingredients\\nare speciﬁed, but the end result (such as how it tastes) is not. ASTM C270 gives the type and\\nquantity of ingredients foreach type of mortar. For example, Type N cement lime mortar has\\none part cement, one part lime, and from 2 1\\n4 to 3 times the volume of cementitious materials\\nof sand. The sand is speciﬁed under ASTM C144. If the upper limit of three parts of sand is\\nchosen, then an acceptable “recipe” for Type N mortar is 1 ft 3 of cement, 1 ft 3 of hydrated\\nlime, and 6 ft 3 of sand. An experienced mason would call this a 1:1:6 mix. NCMA TEK 9-1A\\ngives more detail on mortar, including how to select, specify, and construct with it.\\nGrout\\nMasonry grout is speciﬁed under ASTM C476. Grout consists of cement, sand, and water and\\nmay also include lime, coarse aggregates, or admixtures. The most common application of\\nmasonry grout is in reinforced masonry to bond the masonry to the reinforcing steel. Hollow\\nCMUs have large cells (approximately 4-in. square) into which reinforcing bars can be placed\\nand the remaining void space subsequently ﬁlled with grout. Because the masonry unit is\\nabsorptive, the grout must have a higher slump than concrete. The grout that is placed in the\\ncells experiences suction from the walls of the units, and water is lost from the grout mix.\\nIf the grout is not “soupy” to start with, then it will not ﬁll the void sp aces properly. If you\\nvisit a construction site just after the grout is placed in a masonry wall, the moisture that is\\nabsorbed into the masonry units will be clearly visible on the outside of the wall. The units\\nwill be a darker gray because of the absorption of the water. Cases have been reported where\\nthis observation resulted in the realization that grout was not ﬂowing to the bottom of the grout\\npour because of the absence of the change in CMU coloration.\\nMost concrete is placed with a slump of 3 in. to 5 in. Masonry grout, however, is placed\\nwith a slump of 8 in. to 11 in. Keep in mind that the slump test is performed with a cone that\\nis only 12 in. tall, so an 11-in. slump is quite high (wet). Many engineers are alarmed by this\\nbecause of their experience with concrete. It is important that the engineer realize that grout\\nmust have a high slump in order to be placed and consolidated properly. The water–cement\\nratio will be reduced when the units absorb some of the water from the grout, and the grout\\nwill be much stronger as a result. After grout is pl aced in the cells to the grout lift height, an\\nimmersible vibrator is used to consolidate it. Often, when grout is placed to its ﬁnal height\\nto the top of a wall, the top surface of the grout will recede as much as 1 in. after it is\\nvibrated. This is caused by a combination of the vibration consolidating the grout and the\\nCMUs absorbing a portion of the water in the grout.\\nReinforcing\\nThe reinforcing bars used in reinforced masonry construction are the same as those used in\\nreinforced concrete. See Section 1.16 of this text for a discussion of reinforcing bars. However,\\njoint reinforcing is unique to masonry. Joint reinforcing is speciﬁed under ASTM A951. It is\\nusually galvanized for corrosion protection. Its role is mostly for control of shrinkage cracks;\\nhowever, it can be included as part of the reinforcing in shear walls in allowable stress design.\\nSince it cannot be included in strength design, it will not be considered further in this discussion.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 625}, page_content='McCormac c20.tex V2 - January 10, 2013 8:55 A.M. Page 606\\n606 CHAPTER 2 0 Reinforced Concrete Masonry\\nReinforcing bars are placed in the hollow cells of walls made of hollow CMUs. They are\\nplaced vertically for walls that span vertically. The use of spacers is recommended to ensure the\\ncorrect location of the bars within the wall. Most walls have a single layer of reinforcing, hence\\nthe bars are located in the center of the wall. This is quite different from concrete beams, for\\nexample, where the steel is placed near the tension surface for greater efﬁciency. Most masonry\\nwalls are subjected to wind or earthquake loads that are reversible. Placing the steel off-center\\nin such a wall would be effective for wind pressure but ineffective for wind suction. If a wall\\nhas a lateral load that is not reversible, such as an earth retaining wall, then placing the steel\\noff-center can prove to be more efﬁcient. However, the designer must be sure the steel is placed\\noff-center in the correct direction. Thicker walls (12 in. or more) may be reinforced with two\\nlayers of reinforcement, which is common practice in areas of high seismicity.\\nReinforcing steel bars can also be placed horizontally in bond beams. These are used in\\nwalls that span horizontally, for example, between masonry columns embedded within masonry\\nwalls (called pilasters). Bond beams are also used to provide for shear reinforcement in\\nshear walls. Most designers think of shear reinforcement as vertical stirrups. However,\\nin shear walls, the direction of the shear force is horizontal, hence so is the shear reinforcement.\\nThis was also the case for concrete shear walls discussed in Chapter 18 of this text. Bond\\nbeams are usually constructed using CMUs that have webs that are not the full height of the\\nunit. By having half-high webs, a horizontal space is created in a masonry wall, allowing\\nfor placement of the horizontal reinforcing steel. Often two bars are placed in a single bond\\nbeam. Since the vast majority of CMUs are 8 in. high, the vertical spacing of bond beams is a\\nmultiple of 8 in. For example, a wall might have horizontal bond beams,each containing two\\n#5 bars, spaced in every fourth course, hence every 32 in. A course is simply a conti nuous\\nhorizontal layer of masonry units.\\n20.3 Speciﬁed Compressive Strength of Masonry\\nThe speciﬁed compressive strength of masonry, f ′\\nm , is analogous to the speciﬁed compressive\\nstrength of concrete, f ′\\nc . Many students, and even designers not familiar with masonry, confuse\\nmasonry unit strengths with f ′\\nm . Unit strengths are the compressive strength of the units without\\nthe inclusion of mortar, grout, or reinforcement. Unit strengths are higher than f ′\\nm .T h em o s t\\ncommonly speciﬁed value of f ′\\nm is 1500 psi for concrete masonry. Compliance with the speciﬁed\\nvalue can be demonstrated in two ways: the unit strength method or the prism test method.\\nThe prism test method requires the construction and testing of large test specimens, which is\\nexpensive and which could result in obtaining a low test result well after walls are ﬁnished.\\nThe most common method of determining compliance with f ′\\nm is the unit strength method. In\\nthis method, the unit compressive strength and mortar type are used along with Table 2 in ACI\\n530.1 (shown as Table 20.1 below) to determine compliance.\\nTABLE 20. 1 Compressive Strength of Masonry Related to Unit\\nCompressive Strength and Mortar Type (from ACI 530.1, Table 2)\\nNet Area Compressive Strength of\\n Net Area Compressive Strength of\\nConcrete Masonry Units, psi (MPa)\\n Masonry, psi (MPa)\\nType M or S Mortar\\n Type N Mortar\\n—\\n 1900\\n (13.10)\\n 1350\\n (9.31)\\n1900\\n (13.10)\\n 2150\\n (14.82)\\n 1500\\n (10.34)\\n2800\\n (19.31)\\n 3050\\n (21.03)\\n 2000\\n (13.79)\\n3750\\n (25.86)\\n 4050\\n (27.92)\\n 2500\\n (17.24)\\n4800\\n (33.10)\\n 5250\\n (36.20)\\n 3000\\n (20.69)\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 626}, page_content='McCormac c20.tex V2 - January 10, 2013 8:55 A.M. Page 607\\n20.5 Walls with Out-of-Plane Loads—Non–Load-Bearing Walls 607\\nAs an example, if a 1900-psi unit compressive strength is speciﬁed along with Type S mortar,\\nthen the net area compressive strength of masonry is 1500 psi. The minimum compressive\\nstrength in ASTM C90 is 1900 psi, so this level of strength is obtained without specifying a\\nhigher-strength unit. If the designer has speciﬁed f ′\\nm = 1500 psi, then this combination of unit\\nstrength and mortar type would comply without testing prisms.\\n20.4 Maximum Flexural Tensile Reinforcement\\nThe masonry code (ACI 530 Section 3 .3.3.5) limits the area of tensile reinforcing in order to\\nensure ductility. The provision is analogous to the ACI 318 philosophy of a tension-controlled\\nsection but not exactly the same. The masonry code does not vary theφ factor as a penalty for\\nnot having a tension-controlled section. The maximum ﬂexural tensile reinforcement provision\\napplies only to members havingMu /(Vu dv ) ≥ 1. Members with Mu /(Vu dv )< 1 are stocky\\nmembers that are not controlled by ﬂexure. This provision requires that the tensile strain in the\\nreinforcing steel be at least 50% greater than the yield strain. This 50% factor corresponds to a\\nductility factor, μ,o f1 .5. For intermediate reinforced shear walls, the μ factor is increased to\\nμ = 3, and for special reinforced shear walls, μ = 4. Axial load, if present, must be included in\\nthis calculation. The axial load to be considered is D + 0.75L + 0.525QE where QE is the effect\\nof horizontal seismic (earthquake-induced) forces. The effect of compression reinforcement,\\neven without lateral restraining reinforcement, may be included when calculating maximum\\nﬂexural tensile reinforcement. The impact of this provision is to limit the amount of reinforcing\\nsteel that can be placed in a masonry member. Axial compression reduces this maximum\\npermitted amount. Alternatively, for a given amount of reinforcing steel, these provisions\\nimpose a limit on the amount of axial compression permitted. Examples of the application of\\nthis limit are included in the example problems for this chapter.\\n20.5 Walls with Out-of-Plane Loads—\\nNon–Load-Bearing Walls\\nA signiﬁcant number of masonry walls are subjected to out-of-plane loads (wind and earth-\\nquake) but do not have any external axial loads bearing on them. Picture a simple rectangular\\nbuilding, such as a convenience store, with a bar-joist roof. If the joist span in the north–south\\ndirection, then they bear on the masonry walls on the east and west end of the building. The\\nwalls on the north and south side have no bar joists bearing on them, hence they are considered\\nnon–load-bearing. Of course, they support their own weight and perhaps just a very small part\\nof the roof load, but not much. The design of reinforced masonry walls with small or no axial\\nload is virtually the same as the design of reinforced concrete one-way slabs. However, the\\nslab stands up and spans vertically. The roof must provide lateral support at the top, and the\\nfooting must provide lateral support at the bottom.\\nFigure 20.1 shows the cross section of a wall with vertical reinforcing bars located in\\ncells at a horizontal spacing, s. In this case, counting the seven cells from one bar to the next,\\nthe spacing would be 7 × 8i n . = 56 in.

Hence,t ≥ 2 × 3.55 in.= 7.10 in. The designer would then\\nselect the next available thickness above 7.10 in., or 8 in. This method is given only to show the\\nstudent how to rationally select wall thicknesses. However, since it is just as easy to just guess\\nthe thickness, rather thanρ, the authors prefer assuming wall thickness at the beginning.\\nIf a 6-in. wall had been selected, the resulting area of reinforcing steel,As,w o u l dh a v e\\nbeen 0.112 in2/ft (compared to 0.0789 in2/ft for the 8-in. wall). This area can be satisﬁed using #5\\nat 33.2 in., which rounds down to 32 in. The resulting steel strain,ϵs, is 0.00912, which exceeds\\no n ea n dah a l ft i m e sϵy, so the wall is ductile, though not as ductile as the 8-in. wall. The authors\\nprefer using the 8-in. wall thickness simply because 6-in. units have somewhat smaller cells and\\nare harder to reinforce and grout. Either solution meets the code.\\nShear capacity of walls loaded out of plane is almost never an issue. Generally speaking,\\nthe shear capacity is many times the demand. For that reason, only shear walls and lintels, which\\nare covered later in this chapter, are designed for shear.\\nThe wall just designed was assumed to be fully grouted. If it had beenpartially grouted,\\nmuch more complicated equations that involve nonrectangular compression zones are involved.\\nHowever, just as in the case of design of T beams in Chapter 5, these more complex equations\\napply only if the neutral axis is deep enough to go into the webs. In masonry design, if the\\nneutral axial depth,c, does not exceed the face-shell thickness (11\\n4 in. for 8 in. and larger wall\\nthickness), then the equations for fully grouted walls apply also to partially grouted walls. In the\\npreceding solution, in which an 8-in. wall with #5 bars at 40 in. was chosen, the value ofc was\\n0.484 in., much less than the face-shell thickness. Therefore, this solution would also apply to a\\npartially grouted wall. Partial grout means that only the reinforced cells are grouted, not the ones\\nin between. As a practical matter, in order to contain the grout within the reinforced cell, the\\nwebs on each side of each grouted cells must be mortared. This means that the use of face-shell\\nbedding must be modiﬁed accordingly, if partial grout is speciﬁed.\\n20.6 Masonry Lintels\\nMost masonry walls contain openings such as doors and windows. The loads above these open-\\nings must span these openings to be supported by the adj acent masonry. The beam that spans\\nover such an opening, regardless of what it is made of, is called a lintel. Lintels can be made\\nof structural steel, precast concrete, or masonry. This section discusses design and construction\\nof masonry lintels. Many designers choose to use structural steel or pr ecast concrete lintels\\nsimply because they are unfam iliar with the design of masonry lintels. An illustration of a\\nmasonry lintel is shown in Figure 20.3. The large door opening shown might be a garage door,\\nso the span can be quite large. This illustration shows a three-course lintel, but the number of\\ncourses could range from one to the total number of courses available above the door opening.\\nThe lintel must be fully grouted (ACI 530 Section 3.3.4.2.4), but the masonry above it need'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 631}, page_content='McCormac c20.tex V2 - January 10, 2013 8:55 A.M.

The lintel is shown to have a span larger than the clear opening, ln . The additional\\nspan represents the bearing length, which ACI 530 (1.13.1.3) requires to be at least 4 in. In\\nmost cases, the bearing length is 8 in. for CMU construction. The lintel must support its own\\nweight, the weight of masonry above it, and any loads on top of the wall. For example, it\\nwould certainly be possible to have bar joists bearing on top of the wall for its entire length.\\nThe lintel would then have to support the load they impose on the top of the wall.\\nLintels must be designed to resist bending and shear, and often their deﬂection must be\\ncalculated and compared to the limit of l/600 under dead plus live unfactored load (ACI 530\\nSection 1.13.1.4.1).\\nAll of the equations developed for non–load-bearing walls (Eq. 20.1–20.7) apply equally\\nto lintels. The main difference is that the value of d for lintels is not half of the lintel depth but\\nrather is more on the order of reinforced concrete beams. The steel is usually placed as close\\nto the bottom of a lintel as cover requirements permit. Sometimes, however, instead of using\\nthe U-shaped unit shown in the bottom course in Figure 20.3, Section A–A, the designer may\\nuse units with half-high webs as described earlier when discussing bond beams. These units do\\nnot physically allow the steel to be pl aced close to the bottom of the lintel because the webs\\nare in the way. In this case, the steel has approximately a 4-in. cover of masonry below it.\\nAlso, these types of units have vertical cells that have to be “dammed up” to contain the grout\\nthat is placed in them. This dam is often provided using a 2 × 8 wooden form that is also\\nthere to support the lintel during construction. If the units with half-high webs are inverted,\\nthen the reinforcing steel can be placed as close to the bottom as cover limits allow.\\nShear Design of Lintels\\nShear design of masonry lintels by strength design is very similar to that of reinforced concrete\\nbeams covered in Chapter 7. While it is possible to provide stirrups in masonry lintels, it is\\ndifﬁcult and the authors do not recommend it. Usually if you just make the lintel deeper, no\\nstirrups will be required. For this reason, and for reasons of space limitations, the design of\\nstirrups for lintels is not discussed further. The strength reduction factor for shear for reinforced\\nmasonry is φ = 0.8.\\nIf no shear reinforcement is provided, then the masonry must resist the design shear, Vu .\\nThe masonry shear capacity is given by ACI 530 Equation 3-23,\\nVnm =\\n[\\n4.0 − 1.75\\n(Mu\\nVu d\\n⎡]\\nAn\\n√\\nf ′m + 0.25Pu\\nThe value of Mu /Vu dv need not be taken greater than one, and lintels do not ordinarily carry\\naxial loads, so the worst (and most common) case value for Vnm is\\nVnm = 2.25An\\n√\\nf ′m (Equation 20-8)'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 632}, page_content='McCormac c20.tex V2 - January 10, 2013 8:55 A.M.

With reference to Figure 20.3, the span would be ln plus one-half\\nof the bearing length on each end. So if the bearing length is 8 in., as it normally is for CMU\\nconstruction, then l = ln + 8 in. This same span is used to calculate bending moments in the\\nlintel as well. Although some end restraint is provided to the lintel by the masonry surrounding\\nit at the supports, it is customary to design single span lintels as simply supported.\\nThe design shear is permitted to be reduced to that value occurring at a distance d/2\\nfrom the face of the support (ACI 530 Section 2.3.6.4). In reinforced concrete design, this\\ncorresponding distance is d instead of d/2, and the same limitations apply as for reinforced\\nconcrete. The value of Vnm varies along the span for typical lintels, and the term Mu /Vu d near\\nthe supports is usually small where the design shear, Vu , is large. Therefore, if the designer\\nis willing to make the effort, the value of Vnm from ACI Equation 3-23 can be evaluated at\\nincrements along the beam, resulting in a larger value than you get from Equation 20.8.\\nCracking Moment\\nMSJC 2008 Section 3.3.4.2.2.2 states, “The nominal ﬂexural strength of a beam shall not be\\nless than 1.3 multiplied by the nominal cracking moment of the beam, Mcr .

(horizontal). The opening is\\n10 ft high and the distance from the bottom of the lintel to the top of the wall is 4 ft. The lintel\\nmust carry a uniform live load of 300 plf and a uniform dead load of 320 plf in addition to the\\nmasonry’s own weight. The wall is constructed of 8-in. thick (nominal) CMU, assume simple\\nsupports, and provide a bearing length of 8 in. at each end. The lintel and the masonry above\\nit are fully grouted.

Applying the load factors of ACI 530, which references ASCE 7-10,\\nwu = 1.2wD + 1.6wL = 1.2 × (320 plf+ 80 psf× 4f t )+ 1.6 × 300 plf= 1248 plf\\nMn = wul2\\n8 = 1248 × 162\\n8 = 39,936 ft-lb= 479.2 in-k\\nThere are many designs that will work. In this design, the authors will look at the shallowest\\nlintel permitted by the maximum reinforcement provisions and work from there. This approach\\nensures that this limit is not violated, but it may lead to designs with more reinforcement in the\\nlintel than is practical.

How-\\never, the value of a should be based on the actual steel area chosen, not the area theoretically\\nrequired. Be sure to use Ase to calculate a so the effect of axial load is included.\\nSecondary Bending Moments in Walls Loaded\\nOut-of-Plane: TheP-δ Effect\\nThe ACI 530 Code (Section 3.3.5) provides an approximate method to account for secondary\\nmoments in walls that are loaded both axially and out-of-plane. The lateral load produces\\ndeﬂections that are ampliﬁed by the axial load. This effect is accounted for in reinforced\\nconcrete columns by the moment magniﬁer (Chapter 11 ), but the masonry code uses a different\\napproach called the P-δ effect. In order to comply with the limitations of the method, the axial\\nload is limited to Pu ≤ 0.20f ′\\nmAg . For slender walls having h/t exceeding 30, Pu ≤ 0.05f ′\\nm Ag\\n(the coefﬁcient reduces from 0.20 to 0.05). The code does not give guidance on how to design\\nwalls outside this range, so the authors recommend limiting wall designs to the permitted range.\\nThe available research does not include walls outside this range.\\nMu = wu h2\\n8 +\\nPuf eu\\n2 + Pu δu (ACI 530 Equation 3-26)\\nwhere Pu = Puw + Puf .\\nThe ﬁrst two terms of the preceding equation are the moment from lateral load (e.g.,\\nwind or earthquake) and the moment at mid-height from eccentric axial load superimposed on\\nthe top of the wall from a ﬂoor or roof system. The third term is the secondary moment caused\\nby the lateral deﬂection of the wall being acted upon by the axial load, Pu . In this case, Pu is\\nlarger than Puf because it includes the wall weight, Puw . Note that the wall weight does not\\ncause bending in the wall because it is concentric.\\nThe term δu in Equation 3-26 is calculated from Equation 3-29 or 3-30. However, the\\nterm δser is replaced with δu and Mser with Mu . In most cases, Mu > Mser and Equation 3-30\\nis the only equation that applies.\\nδs = 5Mcr h2\\n48Em Ig\\nfor Mcr ≤ Mser (ACI 530 Equation 3-29)\\nδs = 5Mcr h2\\n48Em Ig\\n+ 5(Mser − Mcr )h2\\n48Em Icr\\nfor Mcr ≤ Mser ≤ Mu (ACI 530 Equation 3-30)\\nIn using Code Equation 3-29 or 3-30 in conjunction with Equation 3-26, the calculation of\\nδu is iterative. The ﬁrst calculation produces a value of δu that is then substituted into Code\\nEquation 3-26. This new value of Mu is then substituted into Code Equation 3-30, and a new,\\nlarger value of δu is obtained. This new value is now substituted into Code Equation 3-26,\\nand a new, larger Mu is obtained. This process is repeated until successive calculations show\\nlittle difference indicating convergence. In the event that they do not converge, the wall is not\\nstable, and it must be redesigned. A redesign may involve larger bars, closer bar spacing, a\\nthicker wall, or a larger value of f ′\\nm .'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 638}, page_content='McCormac c20.tex V2 - January 10, 2013 8:55 A.M.

The maximum factored axial load is 1468 lb.\\nIf wall self-weight is added, based on a partially grouted wall with #5 bars at 24-in. centers, the\\ndead load is increased by the wall height times a wall weight of 37 psf.

A similar design for load case 6 results inAs = 0.105 in2/ft, which\\nis more than 0.102 in.2, hence load case 6 controls without the P-δ effect. However, case 4\\nwill have a higher P-δ term, so it is not possible to tell which is more critical without actually\\nmaking the P-δ calculations.

Reinforced concrete shear\\nwalls were discussed in Section 18.5 of this text. Refer to that section to understand the\\nsource of loads for shear walls. The assumptions used to develop equations for walls loaded\\nout of plane are applied to the geometry of shear walls to obtain equations necessary for\\ntheir analysis and design. Most shear walls contain multiple layers of reinforcement (e.g.,\\nFigure 18.8 in Chapter 18). Each of these layers is subjected to a different strain, hence\\npotentially a different stress. The rectangular stress block used for lintels and walls is also\\napplied to the masonry in compression in shear walls.\\nFigure 20.5 shows a shear wall subjected to a compressive strain of ϵmu on the right side\\nand a tensile strain of ϵtu on the left. The axial force and bending moment that would cause this\\nstrain is calculated in the same way as for reinforced concrete columns in Section 10.3 of this\\ntext. Each reinforcing bar has a different strain, hence, potentially a different stress. However,\\nif the strain in any bar is ϵy or more, the stress is fy. If the strain in a bar is compressive, the\\nstress is taken as zero. However, when calculating the maximum ﬂexural tensile reinforcement\\ndescribed in Section 20.4, using the compressive force in reinforcing steel is permitted.\\nFrom the strain diagram in Figure 20.5 using similar triangles, the strain at any location\\nin the wall, ϵi , can be related to ϵmu , c, and the distance to that location from the extreme\\ncompressive ﬁber, ϵi . For CMU construction, ϵmu = 0.0025.\\nϵmu\\nc = ϵtu\\ndv − c = ϵi\\ndi − c\\nThe stress in each bar is the strain in that bar, ϵi , multiplied by Es , but not more than fy.\\nTi = Asi fsi = Asi ϵi Es = Asi\\nϵmu (di − c)\\nc Es ≤ Asi fy\\nThe compressive force in the masonry is determined from the compressive stress block,\\nC = 0.80f ′\\nmatsp = 0.80f ′\\nm(0.80c)tsp = 0.64f ′\\nm ctsp\\nT1\\n²1 ²2 ²3\\n²tu\\n²i\\n²mu\\ntsp\\ndv\\nT2 T3 Ti\\ndi\\nc\\na\\nstrain\\nstress\\n0.80f'm\\nfy\\nFIGURE 2 0 . 5 Shear wall strain and stress.\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 643}, page_content='McCormac c20.tex V2 - January 10, 2013 8:55 A.M.

For example, if a\\nshear wall has Mu = 6000 ft-k, the axial load must fall within the range 550 k < Pu < 1750 k.\\nHowever, the maximum axial load from Equation 3-18 is 1252 k, so this value would control\\ninstead of 1750 k. These limits are approximate in that they were simply read from the graph.\\nShear Capacity of Reinforced Masonry Shear Walls\\nShear design of reinforced masonry shear walls by strength design is very similar to that of\\nreinforced concrete shear walls covered Section 18.6 of this text.\\nThe masonry shear capacity is given by ACI 530 Equation 3-23 in ACI Section 3.3.4.1.2,\\nVnm =\\n[\\n4.0 − 1.75\\n(Mu\\nVu d\\n⎡]\\nAn\\n√\\nf ′m + 0.25Pu (ACI 530 Equation 3-23)\\nThe value of Mu /Vu dv is often less than unity, but not be taken greater than unit. The friction\\nterm, 0.25f ′\\nm , recognizes that axial compression increases shear capacity from frictional effects.\\nThe coefﬁcient of 0.25 implies a coefﬁcient of friction of 0.25. In shear walls, the masonry\\nalone often cannot resist the design shear force, Vu . Additional shear capacity can be provided\\nby shear reinforcement in the form of reinforcing bars in horizontal bond beams. By using units\\nwith webs that are not full height, a horizontal space is provided for placement of horizontal\\nbars. Often two bars are placed in a bond beam, but not always.\\nThe combined capacity of the masonry and the shear reinforcement is given by\\nVn = Vnm + Vns (ACI 530 Equation 3-20)\\nUpper limits are placed on Vn by\\n(a) Where Mu /Vu dv ≤ 0.25:\\nVn ≤ 6Anv f ′\\nm (ACI 530 Equation 3-21)\\n(b) Where Mu /Vu dv > 1.0\\nVn ≤ 4Anv f ′\\nm (ACI 530 Equation 3-22)\\n(c) The maximum value of Vn for Mu /Vu dv between 0.25 and 1.0 can be obtained from\\nlinear interpolation between the two equations.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 646}, page_content='McCormac c20.tex V2 - January 10, 2013 8:55 A.M.

There are just too many variables to solve the equations in a closed form. A graph-\\nical technique or spreadsheet (or other computer software) is needed to design for combined\\naxial load and bending moment. There is not enough room in this single chapter on masonry to\\ndevelop these. A simple spreadsheet is provided for this chapter to assist in the design process.\\nDesign for shear can be done by hand by applying the equations in ACI Code Section 3.3.4.1.2.\\nExample 20.5\\nDesign the shear wall below for shear\\ndv = 288 in., tsp = 7.625 in., h = 192 in., f′\\nm = 1500 psi, fy = 60 ksi\\nPu = 86 k, Mu = 33,880 in-k, Vu = 280 k'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 647}, page_content='McCormac c20.tex V2 - January 10, 2013 8:55 A.M.

The method is also very useful for designing deep beams\\nfor which the usual assumption of linear strain distribution is not valid. This method of design,\\ncommonly referred to as strut-and-tie design, is brieﬂy introduced.\\nC.2 Deep Beams\\nSection 10.7 of the ACI Code deﬁnes a deep beam as a member that\\n(a) Is loaded on one face and supported on the opposite face so that compression struts\\ncan develop between the load and the supports.\\n(b) Has a clear span not more than four times its overall depth or that has regions where\\nconcentrated loads are located within two times the member depth from the support.\\nTransfer girders are one type of deep beam that occur rather frequently. Such members\\nare used to transfer loads laterally from one or more columns to other columns. Sometimes\\nbearing walls also exhibit deep beam action.\\nDeep beams begin to crack at loads ranging from 1\\n3 Pu to 1\\n2 Pu . As a result, elastic analyses\\nare not of much value to us except in one regard: the cracks tell us something about the way\\nthe stresses that cause the cracks are distributed. In other words, they provide information as\\nto how the loads will be carried after cracking.\\nC.3 Shear Span and Behavior Regions\\nThe ratio of the shear span of a beam to its effective depth determines how the beam will fail\\nwhen overloaded. The shear span for a particular beam is shown in Figure C.1, where it is\\nrepresented by the symbola. This is the distance from the concentrated load shown to the face\\nof the support. Should the beam be supporting only a uniform load, the shear span is the clear\\nspan of the beam.\\nWhen shear spans are long, they are referred to as B regions. These are regions for\\nwhich the usual beam theory applies—plane sections remain plain before and after bending.\\nThe letter B stands for beam or for Bernoulli (he is the one who presented the linear strain\\ntheory for beams).\\nIn some situations, the usual beam theory does not apply. When shear spans are short,\\nloads are primarily resisted by arch action rather than beam action. Locations where this occurs\\nare called D regions. The letter D represents discontinuity or disturbance. In such regions, plane\\n675'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 695}, page_content='McCormac b03.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 7:05 P.M.

You should note that the authors used the\\nSt. V enant principle in this ﬁgure to show the extent of the D regions. For more examples, the\\nreader should also examine Figures R.A.1.1 and R.A.1.2 in Appendix A of the ACI Code.\\nD region\\nD region B region D region B region\\nD region\\nD region\\nD region D regionB region B region\\nh\\nh h\\nh\\nh h h\\nhhh\\nh\\nh\\nh\\nh\\nFIGURE C . 2 B and D regions.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 696}, page_content='McCormac b03.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 7:05 P.M. Page 677\\nC.4 Truss Analogy 677\\nC.4 Truss Analogy\\nIf shear spans are very short, inclined cracks extending from the concentrated loads to the sup-\\nports tend to develop. This situation is illustrated in Figure C.3. In effect, the ﬂow of horizontal\\nshear from the longitudinal reinforcement to the compression zone has been interrupted. As a\\nresult, the behavior of the member has been changed from that of a beam to that of a tied arch\\nwhere the reinforcing bars act as the ties of an arch.\\nIn Chapter 8, Section 8.7 of this text, reference was made to the description of reinforced\\nconcrete beams by Ritter-Morsch with the truss analogy method. According to that theory, a\\nreinforced concrete beam with shear reinforcement behaves much like a statically determinate\\nparallel chord truss with pinned joints. The concrete compression block is considered to be the\\ntop chord of the ﬁctitious “truss,” while the tensile reinforcement is considered to act as the\\nbottom chord. The “truss” web is said to consist of the stirrups acting as vertical tension\\nmembers, while the portions of the concrete between the diagonal cracks are assumed to act\\nas diagonal compression members. Such a “truss” is shown in Figure C.4, which is a copy of\\nFigure 8.4 presented in Chapter 8.\\nIn this ﬁgure, the compression concrete and the stirrups are shown with dashed lines.\\nThese lines represent the estimated centers of gravity of those forces. The tensile forces are\\nrepresented with solid lines because those forces clearly act along the reinforcing bar lines.\\na ≤ d\\ntensile reinforcement\\nFIGURE C . 3 A very short shear span.\\nconcrete between\\ninclined cracks (diagonals) stirrups (verticals)\\ncompression concrete\\n(top chord)\\ntensile steel\\n(bottom chord)\\ndiagonal tension cracks\\nFIGURE C . 4 Truss analogy.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 697}, page_content='McCormac b03.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 7:05 P.M.

The resulting values must be divided by the\\ncapacity reduction factor φ for shearing forces (0.75) to obtain the required nominal stresses.\\nThe designer needs to represent the D regions of members, which fail in shear, with\\nsome type of model before beginning the design. The model selected for beams with shear\\nreinforcement is the truss model, as it is the best one available at this time.\\nFor this discussion, the beam of Figure C.5 is considered. The internal and external forces\\nacting on this beam, which is assumed to be cracked, are shown. To select a strut-and-tie model\\nfor such a beam, all the stirrups cut by the imaginary section (see Figure C.5) are lumped into\\none. In a similar fashion, the concrete parallel to a diagonal is also lumped together in one\\nmember.\\nWith the strut-and-tie method, forces are resisted by an idealized internal truss such as\\nthe triangular one sketched in Figure C.6. The member and joints of this truss are designed\\nso that they will be able to resist the computed forces. The truss selected must, of course,\\nbe smaller than the beam that encloses it, and any reinforcing steel must be given adequate\\ncover. For a ﬁrst illustration, a short deep beam supporting a concentrated load is shown in\\nFigure C.6.\\nV arious types of nodes are shown in Figure C.7.

According to Schlaich\\nand Weischede, the angle of stress trajectories varies from about 68◦ if l/d ≥ 10 to about 55 ◦\\nif l/d = 2.0.1 A rather common practice, and one that is used in this appendix and is usually\\nsatisfactory, is to assume a 2 vertical to 1 horizontal slope for the struts. This will result in a\\nvalue of θ = 63◦56′. The dimensions selected for the truss model must ﬁt into the D region\\ninvolved, so the angles may need to be adjusted.\\n1 J¨org Schlaich and Dieter Weischede, Detailing of Concrete Structures, Bulletin d’Information 150, Comit´e Euro-International\\n‘du B´eton, Paris (March 1982), 163 pages.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 701}, page_content='McCormac b03.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 7:05 P.M.

Selection of strut-and-tie model —A truss is selected to support the concentrated loads,\\nand that truss is analyzed.\\n2. Design of vertical stirrups —A stirrup bar size is assumed, and its strength is assumed\\nto equal its cross-sectional area times its yield stress. The number of stirrups required\\nequals the vertical force divided by the strength of one of the stirrups. The required\\nspacing of these stirrups is determined. If it is too large or too small, a different stirrup\\nsize is assumed, and the procedure is repeated.\\n3. Selection of horizontal reinforcing across beam perpendicular to span—The appendix to\\nthe code does not require that reinforcing such as this be used, but it is likely that its\\nuse will appreciably reduce cracking. As a result, we can select an amount of steel equal\\nto that listed in ACI Section 11.7.4 for regular deep beam design.

The\\ndesign strength of such ties is provided by ACI Appendix Equation A-6.\\n6. Analysis of nodal zones—Finally, ACI Appendix Equation A-8 is used to determine the\\nstrength of the nodal zones.

Many organizations are dedicated to studying the earthquake response and design\\nof structures. Each earthquake t eaches us new lessons, and we continually reﬁne our code\\nrequirements based on such lessons.\\nEarthquakes produce horizontal and vertical ground motions that shake the base of a struc-\\nture. Because the movement of the rest of the structure is resisted by the structure’s mass (inertia),\\nground shaking creates deformations in the structure, and these deformations produce forces in the\\nstructure. Earthquake motions produce seismic loads on structures, even those that are not part of\\nthe lateral load-resisting system. These forces can be both horizontal and vertical and can subject\\nstructural elements to axial forces, moments, and shears whose magnitudes depend on many of\\nthe properties of the structure, such as its mass, its stiffness, and its ductility. Also important is\\nthe structure’s period of vibration (the time that the structure takes to vibrate back and forth later-\\nally). In this appendix, the seismic design of reinforced concrete structures is approached from the\\nviewpoint of code application. Calculation of seismic design forces is discussed, element design\\nand detailing for those forces is explained, and examples are provided.\\nThe seismic design of reinforced concrete structures is addressed by the general design\\nprovisions of ACI 318 and also by the special seismic-design provisions of Chapter 21 of ACI\\n318. Reinforced concrete structures designed and detailed according to ACI 318 are intended\\nto resist earthquakes without structural collapse. In general terms, the strength of an earthquake\\ndepends on the accelerations, veloc ities, and displ acements of the gr ound motion that it pro-\\nduces. Seismic design loads are prescribed by Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other\\nStructures (ASCE/SEI 7-10).1 In that document, the severity of the design earthquake motion\\nfor a concrete structure is described in terms of the structure’s seismic design category (SDC),\\nwhich depends on the structure’s geographic location and also the soil on which it is built.\\nStructures assigned to the lowest seismic design category, SDC A, must meet only the general\\ndesign provisions of ACI 318 and do not have to meet the special requirements of Chapter 21\\nof ACI 318. Structures assigned to higher SDCs (B, C, D, E, or F) have increasing seismic\\ndemands, however, and must meet the requirements of Chapter 21 of ACI 318, which increase\\nin severity with higher SDC. For those higher seismic design categories, the requirements of\\nChapter 21 of ACI 318 are based on the assumption that a reinforced concrete structure responds\\ninelastically. Inelastic behavior is characterized by yielding of the reinforcing steel as described\\nin Chapter 3, Section 3.6 of this textbook. Structural members whose reinforcing steel yields\\ncan dissipate some of the energy imparted to the structure by an earthquake, and the forces\\nthat develop in such members during an earthquake are less than they would be if the structure\\nresponded elastically. Seismic design categories are discussed in more detail in Section D.5 of\\n1 American Society of Civil Engineers, Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures (Reston, V A: ASCE),\\nChapters 11–23.\\n683'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 703}, page_content='McCormac b04.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 7:16 P.M. Page 684\\n684 APPENDIX D Seismic Design of Reinforced Concrete Structures\\nthis appendix. For now, let’s continue with a discussion of the fundamental steps of earthquake\\ndesign according to the load provisions of ASCE 7-10 and the element design and deta iling\\nprovisions of Chapter 21 of ACI 318-11.\\nD.2 Maximum Considered Earthquake\\nAreas with high risk of signiﬁcant ground motion, such as the West Coast of the United States,\\nhave the highest seismic hazard level. Most areas of the United States have at least some level\\nof seismic risk, however. A large part of ASCE 7-10 is dedicated to determining seismic design\\nforces. These forces are based on the “maximum considered earthquake” (MCE), which is an\\nextreme earthquake, considered to occur only once every 2500 years. The severity of MCE-\\nlevel ground shaking is described in terms of the spectral responseacceleration parameters SS\\nand S1, whose values are given in contour maps provided within ASCE 7 and also available\\nfrom the United States Geological Service (USGS) website (www.usgs.gov). The parameter\\nSS is a measure of how strongly the MCE affects structures with a short period (0.2 sec).\\nThe parameter S1 is a measure of how strongly the MCE affects structures with a longer\\nperiod (1 sec). These are called spectral response parameters, and their values are provided in\\nFigures 22-1 through 22-14 of ASCE/SEI 7-10. 2 If S1 is less than or equal to 0.04 and SS is\\nless than or equal to 0.15, the structure is assigned to SDC A. Higher values of S1 and SS\\ncorrespond to successively higher seismic design categories. SS and S1 are proportions or ratios\\nof gravity. For example, in parts of southern California, the value of SS may be 1.0 (100% of\\nthe acceleration of gravity), whereas in parts of the Midwest, it may be only a few percent.\\nD.3 Soil Site Class\\nThe spectral response parameters determined above are modiﬁed based on the structure’s soil\\nsite class . The soil at the site is classiﬁed into soil site class A through F in accordance\\nwith Table 20.3-1 and Section 20.3 of ASCE/SEI 7, using only the upper 100 ft of the site\\nproﬁle. The lowest soil site class, site class A (hard rock), gives a relatively low seismic\\ndesign force. Higher soil site classes give higher seismic design forces. If such site-speciﬁc\\ndata are not available, ASCE/SEI 7 permits the registered design professional preparing the\\nsoil investigation report to estimate soil properties from known geologic conditions. If the\\nsoil properties are not sufﬁciently known, site class D is used unless the authority having\\njurisdiction or geotechnical data determines that site class E or F is appropriate. Once the soil\\nsite class is assigned, the corresponding site coefﬁcients for short and long periods, Fa and Fv ,\\nrespectively, are determined using Table D.1 and the values of SS and S1 as described above.\\nMCE Spectral Response Accelerations and\\nDesign Response Accelerations\\nThe MCE spectral response accelerations (related to design forces) for short periods (SMS ) and\\nfor longer (1- s) periods (SM1) are obtained by multiplying each spectral res ponse acceleration\\nparameter (SS and S1) by its corresponding site coefﬁcient:\\nSMS = Fa SS (ASCE/SEI Equation 11.4-1)\\nSM1 = Fv S1 (ASCE/SEI Equation 11.4-2)\\n2 ASCE/SEI 7-10, pp. 210–227.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 704}, page_content='McCormac b04.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 7:16 P.M.

The seismic hazard level depends on the geographic\\nlocation of the structure. Where S1 is less than 0.75, the seismic design category can be\\ndetermined from Table D.3(a) alone where certain conditions apply. 3 When Table D.3(a) and\\n(b) give different results for the same structure, the more severe SDC is used.

Page 688\\n688 APPENDIX D Seismic Design of Reinforced Concrete Structures\\nThe vertical seismic load must be considered to act either upward or downward,\\nwhichever is more critical for design. The critical design load combination for most reinforced\\nconcrete columns usually occurs below their balanced point. In this region, columns generally\\nhave less moment capacity if axial compression is decreased (see Figures 10.4 and 10.8 in\\nChapter 10 of this textbook). Hence, an upward seismic load would result in reduced moment\\ncapacity.\\nLateral Forces\\nStructures assigned to seismic design category A are designed for the effects of static lateral\\nforces applied independently in each of two ort hogonal plan directions. In each direction, the\\ndesign lateral forces are applied simultaneously at all levels. The design lateral force at each\\nlevel is determined as follows:\\nFx = 0.01Wx (ASCE/SEI 7-10 Equation 1.4-1)\\nwhere\\nFx = the design lateral force applied at story x\\nWx = the portion of the total dead load of the structure, D, located or assigned to level\\nx\\nQuite simply, a structure assigned to SDC A is designed for a lateral seismic load equal\\nto 1% of its design dead load. Structures assigned to SDC A must also meet requirements for\\nload path connections, connection to supports, and anchorage of concrete or masonry walls.4\\nStructures assigned to SDC B through SDC F must be designed using a more detailed\\nmethod. One such method is the equivalent lateral force procedure, in which the design seismic\\nbase shear, V, in each principal plan direction is determined as:\\nV = Cs W (ASCE/SEI 7-10 Equation 12.8-1)\\nwhere\\nCs = the seismic response coefﬁcient determined in accordance with ASCE/SEI Section\\n12.8.1.1\\nW = the effective seismic weight (ASCE/SEI Section 12.7.2)\\nIt includes the total dead load and other loads that are likely to be present during an\\nearthquake. For example, at least 25% of the ﬂoor live load in storage areas must be included.\\nWhere partitions are present, the larger of the actual partition weight or 10 psf (0.48 kN/m2)\\nmust be included. The total operating weight of permanent equipment must be included. Where\\nthe ﬂat roof snow load, Pf , exceeds 30 psf (1.44 kN/m 2), 20% of the uniform design snow\\nload, regardless of actual roof slope, is included.\\nThe seismic response coefﬁcient, Cs , is determined by\\nCS = SDS\\nR/Ie\\n(ASCE/SEI 7-10 Equation 12.8-2)\\nand need not exceed\\nCS = SDI\\nT (R/Ie) for T ≤ TL (ASCE/SEI 7-10 Equation 12.8-3)\\n4 ASCE/SEI 7-10 Section 11.7.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 708}, page_content='McCormac b04.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 7:16 P.M.

Such bars provide the frame with seismic load–resisting capability that may not\\nhave been required by analysis. Columns with clear height less than or equal to ﬁve times the\\ndimensionc1 must be designed for shear in accordance with ACI Section 21.3.3. The term c1\\nis the dimension of a rectangular (or equivalent rectangular column, capital, or bracket) in the\\ndirection of the span for which moments are being calculated. The design shear is determined\\nas the summation of the moment capacity at the faces of the joints at each end of the column,\\ndivided by the distance between those faces. This approach, referred to as capacity design\\nfor shear, is intended to ensure that the columns do not fail in shear during an earthquake.\\nIf the moment capacity of a column is larger than that required based on analysis (due, for\\nexample, to reinforcing bars with cross-sectional areas greater than the theoretically required\\nareas), then the shear capacity of the column must be correspondingly increased.

In addition, beams (members with axial compressive\\nloads, Pu ,l e s st h a nAg f ′\\nc/10) must be designed for shear using capacity design as required in\\nACI 318 Section 21.3.4 and illustrated in Figure D.2. Beams must also be detailed for ductility,\\nusing closed spirals, closed hoops, or closed rectangular ties to conﬁne the concrete so that it\\nwill be stronger and more ductile. Members with larger values ofPu must meet the require-\\nments for columns in ACI 318 Section 21.3.5. These also include more stringent requirements\\nfor concrete conﬁnement.\\nSpecial moment frames are permitted in any seismic design category (ASCE 7-10,\\nTable 12.2-1) and must satisfy ACI 318 Sections 21.5 through 21.8. ACI 318 Section 21.5\\napplies only to ﬂexural members in special moment frames. As with intermediate moment\\nframes, a ﬂexural member in a special moment frame is deﬁned as one having a factored\\naxial compressive force on the member,Pu , that does not exceed Ag f ′\\nc/10. Such a ﬂexural\\nmember must have a clear span, ln, not less than four times its effective depth. Its width,\\nbw , cannot be less than the smaller of 0.3 h and 10 in. Additionally its width, bw , must not\\nexceed the width of the s upporting member, c2, plus a distance on each side of s upporting\\nmember equal to the smaller of (a) the width of supporting member, c2, and (b) 0.75 times\\nthe overall dimension of supporting member, c1. These geometric limits are intended to\\nprovide greater ductility. A limit of 0.025 is imposed on the longitudinal reinforcement ratio,\\nto enhance ﬂexural ductility and avoid congestion. A minimum of two bars must be provided\\ncontinuously at both top and bottom. The positive moment strength at any joint face must be\\nat least one-half the negative moment strength of the ﬂexural member.

Hoops are required in regions expected to\\nexperience hinging. Where hoops are not required, stirrups having seismic hooks at both ends\\nmust be provided, spaced at a distance not more than d/2 throughout the length of the member.\\nMembers of special moment frame must be designed for shear using the capacity design\\nprocedures explained above. When members of special moment frames are subjected to com-\\nbined ﬂexure and factored axial compressive forces exceeding Ag f ′\\nc/10, additional requirements\\nmust be met. Geometric requirements include the following:\\n1. The smallest cross-sectional dimension, measured on a line passing through the geometric\\ncentroid, must be at least 12 in.\\n2. The ratio of the shortest cross-sectional dimension to the perpendicular dimension must\\nbe at least 0.4 in.\\nACI 318 Section 21.6.2 requires that columns of special moment frames be designed\\nso that their nominal ﬂexural strengths are 20% stronger than those of the beams framing\\ninto a beam–column joint. This requirement is intended to ensure that if hinges should form\\nat a beam–column joint, they would occur in beams rather than columns. If hinges form in\\ncolumns, the result may be collapse of the frame. This requirement is waived if the columns’\\nlateral strength and stiffness are ignored in determining the structure’s strength and stiffness,\\nsuch as in a braced frame.\\nThe longitudinal reinforcement in columns of special moment frames must be between\\n1% and 6% of the gross cross-sectional area. In addition, lap splices must meet the requirements\\nin ACI 318 Section 21.6.3.2.\\nTransverse reinforcement requirements (ACI 318 Section 21.6.4) for special moment\\nframes are more stringent than those for ordinary or intermediate moment frames, and are\\nintended to provide even higher ductility.\\nShear requirements for intermediate moment frames are increased for special moment\\nframes by changing Mnl and Mnr in Figure D.2 to Mpr1 and Mpr2, respectively. Mpr is the\\nprobable ﬂexural strength at the face of the joint considering axial load, if any, using a rein-\\nforcing steel stress of 1.25fy and a φ factor of 1.0. The subscripts 1 and 2 on Mpr denote\\nthe left and right ends of the ﬂexural member, respectively. Similarly, the moments Mnt and\\nMnb in Figure D.2 are changed to Mpr3 and Mpr4, where the subscripts 3 and 4 denote the\\ntop and bottom of the column, respectively. While Chapter 21 of ACI 318 contains additional\\nrequirements for shear strength and development length in tension in special moment frames,\\nthese are more complex than necessary for this introductory text in reinforced concrete design.\\nAdditional information on these and other seismic design provisions for reinforced concrete\\nstructures is provided in Chapter 29 of PCA’s Notes on ACI 318-11, Chapter 29.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\design_of_reinforced.pdf', 'page': 713}, page_content='McCormac b04.tex V2 - January 9, 2013 7:16 P.M.
